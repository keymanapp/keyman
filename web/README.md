## Usage
Open **index.html** or **samples/index.html** in your browser. Be sure to
compile Keyman Engine for Web before viewing the pages.

Refer to the samples for usage details.

To view pages using compiled Keyman Engine for Web,
1. cd to **keyman/web/source**
2. Run `./build.sh`
   - Use `./build.sh --help` for the script's documentation.

### Unit Testing ###

Before running unit tests on Keyman Engine for Web, first run `./build.sh`
according to the instructions above.

Once the build is complete, running `npm test` will run the unit testing suite
on your local machine in-browser. Alternatively, see `unit_tests/test.sh`, which
the former command executes.

### Debugging Unit Tests
1. During development, to run a specific unit test, change the `it` to
   `it.only`. You can also run all tests under a specific group with
   `describe.only`.
2. From this directory, run `./unit_tests/test.sh -debug`. Alternatively, from
   `web/` or any `web/` subdirectory,

   ```
   npm run test -- -debug
   ```

   The `--` part tells `npm` to funnel anything to the script as the script's
   command-line parameters. As long as it's run from somewhere within the `web/`
   folder's hierarchy, that line will always run from `web/`, as that's where
   `package.json` is.

3. When the browser halts, click the "Debug" button which opens a new debugging
   tab.
4. In the Dev console, you can set a breakpoint in your test and refresh the
   page to debug
