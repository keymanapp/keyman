## engine/device-detect

This submodule provides the subset of the main engine's Web-oriented code that's used to detect
the user's device in isolation from the rest of KMW code.  Fortunately, it doesn't have any
cross-references with other top-level KMW code, so it was possible to modularize in the form
seen here.
