  /**
   * JH (2023-04-24): given how it's used within the KMW engine, this seems extremely similar in purpose to
   * `restoringFocus` - it's set before calling an element's focus method to prevent focus-handlers from causing
   * unwanted side-effects.  The ONE critical detail:  KSF / `saveFocus` will block a single check, not waiting for
   * control flow restoration before clearing, where the other matching cases will block 100 (maybe to prevent
   * some sort of event softlock?).
   *
   * So, it's like the `saveFocus` variant immediately clears the flag once checked, while others are intended
   * to only clear the flag once control returns to the method that triggered a focus op.
   *
   * A future refactor should be able to merge the two, though it's worth noting that there are early checks for
   * this, but _not_ `restoringFocus`, in the context-management control-blur event handler.  So, it's not 100%
   * super-straightforward, but a refactor should be manageable all the same.
