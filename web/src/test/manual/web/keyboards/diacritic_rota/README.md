Diacritic Rota keyboard
==============

Version 1.0

Description
-----------

Diacritic Rota keyboard used for testing multitap and longpress.

- longpress on <kbd>1</kbd>: one subkey that is too wide to fit in the
  osk. Keyman is expected to resize the key so that it does fit.
- longpress on <kbd>2</kbd>: Subkeys for A-Z. Subkeys B and Y are
  double wide. The keys are expected to be displayed in multiple rows
  so that each row fits within the width. Note that there are too many
  keys so that the rows don't fit vertically.
- longpress on <kbd>.</kbd>: 8 subkeys which won't fit in one row
  because the base keys are wider. Keyman is expected to display them
  in two rows.
