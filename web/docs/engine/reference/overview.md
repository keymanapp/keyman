*KeymanWeb* is a cross-browser JavaScript input method solution.

The *KeymanWeb 17 API* provides JavaScript functions to allow a website developer to integrate the use of
*KeymanWeb* multi-lingual keyboard mapping into a website, using either a standard or a custom-designed user-interface. The functions are exposed as API calls to the *KeymanWeb* core, the
*On-Screen Keyboard* module, a *Utility function* library, or one of the standard *User Interface* modules.

A *KeymanWeb* instance is automatically constructed when you include the compiled KeymanWeb script (kmw-release.js) in your web page source.

The *KeymanWeb API* comprises the following objects:

- *Core*
:   Exposed as [`keyman`](core).

- *On-Screen Keyboard*
:   Exposed as [`keyman.osk`](osk).

- *Utility Functions*
:   Exposed as [`keyman.util`](util).

- *User Interface*
:   Exposed as [`keyman.ui`](ui).
