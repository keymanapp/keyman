Here are some of the new features we have added to Keyman 18.0 for macOS:

* Keyman Engine for macOS now uses Keyman Core for processing keystrokes, improving reliability and consistency with the Linux and Windows versions of Keyman (#10066)
* List of Keyman keyboards has been moved out of a submenu of the main Input Menu into the Keyman section of the menu (#9777)
