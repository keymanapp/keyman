title: Which keyboards work on Mac?
---

Most Keyman keyboards work on Mac. A small subset of keyboards require features which
are not yet available in version 16.0. These features will be progressively implemented.
Keyman for macOS will inform you when you attempt to install a keyboard if it is using
a currently unsupported feature.

The [Keyman keyboard catalogue](https://keyman.com/keyboards) also includes information
about macOS compatibility for each keyboard.
