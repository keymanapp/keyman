title: Does Keyman for macOS include adware or spyware?
---

Simple answer: No!

We never have and never will include adware or spyware components.

We take your privacy seriously. Keyman does include an error reporting
component, so if you find Keyman crashing, it will report the error to
our server. The error report will contain details about your system
configuration, such as operating system version and free disk space,
but contains no personal data. This information helps us to address
the problem.
