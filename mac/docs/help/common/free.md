title: Is Keyman for macOS really free?
---

Yes! As with all Keyman products, Keyman for macOS is completely free.

The source code for Keyman is freely available as well: you can download
the code, change it, distribute your own version of Keyman, or contribute
your improvments back to the Keyman project so we can all benefit.
