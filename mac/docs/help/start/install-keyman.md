   **Note**: On recent versions of macOS, the first time you enable Keyman by selecting Keyman
   from the menu, you will be prompted to give certain permissions to Keyman. It is
   important that you allow Keyman these permissions, otherwise it will not be able
   to remap the keyboard. [More information on permissions](../troubleshooting/configure-security)

4. Click the input menu and switch to Keyman. Click the input menu again to see the
   installed keyboards in Keyman:Keyboards menu.

   This will show "(None)" at first. You may switch to another keyboard from this menu,
   once they are installed.

   See [Install a Keyman Keyboard](install-keyboard) to learn how to install keyboards.

5. Now you can start typing with the selected keyboard in any text editor or
   application that uses standard macOS input methods.

1.
