## Keyman Configuration Options

If you select the **Options** tab on the Keyman Configuration window, you
will see that there are two configuration options that affect the general
behavior of Keyman, regardless of which keyboard is active:

* **Always show on-screen keyboard**: If this option is ticked, the
  on-screen keyboard will be displayed automatically whenever Keyman
  becomes the active input source.

* **Use verbose Console logging**: If this option is ticked, advanced
  troubleshooting information will be sent to the system log. If the
  Keyman development team is assisting you to resolve a problem, they
  might instruct you to enable this option so you can supply them with a
  log of important debugging messages from Keyman. You can view this log
  information yourself using the Console utility, by filtering to show
  only messages from the Keyman process (although it probably won't be
  very meaningful to you unless you are a computer programmer and you are
  looking at the Keyman for macOS source code). Console is a log viewer
  developed by Apple Inc. and included with macOS.
