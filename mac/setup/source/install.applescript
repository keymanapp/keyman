# Logs a text representation of the specified object or objects, which may be of any type, typically for debugging.
# Works hard to find a meaningful text representation of each object.
# SYNOPSIS
#   dlog(anyObjOrListOfObjects)
# USE EXAMPLES
#   dlog("before")  # single object
#     dlog({ "front window: ", front window }) # list of objects
# SETUP
#   At the top of your script, define global variable DLOG_TARGETS and set it to a *list* of targets (even if you only have 1 target).
#     set DLOG_TARGETS to {} # must be a list with any combination of: "log", "syslog", "alert", <posixFilePath>
#   An *empty* list means that logging should be *disabled*.
#   If you specify a POSIX file path, the file will be *appended* to; variable references in the path
#   are allowed, and as a courtesy the path may start with "~" to refer to your home dir.
#   Caveat: while you can *remove* the variable definition to disable logging, you'll take an additional performance hit.
# SETUP EXAMPLES
#    For instance, to use both AppleScript's log command *and* display a GUI alert, use:
#       set DLOG_TARGETS to { "log", "alert" }
# Note: 
#   - Since the subroutine is still called even when DLOG_TARGETS is an empty list, 
#     you pay a performancy penalty for leaving dlog() calls in your code.
#   - Unlike with the built-in log() method, you MUST use parentheses around the parameter.
#   - To specify more than one object, pass a *list*. Note that while you could try to synthesize a single
#     output string by concatenation yourself, you'd lose the benefit of this subroutine's ability to derive
#     readable text representations even of objects that can't simply be converted with `as text`.
on dlog(anyObjOrListOfObjects)
	global DLOG_TARGETS
	try
		if length of DLOG_TARGETS is 0 then return
