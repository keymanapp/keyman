# This file adds labels based on the scopes in resources/scopes/scopes.json and
# resources/scopes/commit-types.json
# Currently it must be manually kept up to date. Not all labels are added, only
# common ones. The others are commented out. There is still some variance between
# folder names and labels; consider this documentation of that ;-)

#
