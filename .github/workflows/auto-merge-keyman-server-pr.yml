#
# Automatically merges pull requests opened by keyman-server
# The initial use of this action is to increment the patch
# version of Keyman with resources/build/increment-version.sh.
# That script creates a PR and then this workflow will be
# triggered to approve the PR (from github-actions account), and
# then automerge it.
