        When reporting on issues with unexpected output, it is very helpful to include the exact sequence of keys, the output expected, and the output received, for example:

        ```
        Typed: <kbd>a</kbd> <kbd>b</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>
        Received: "abc"
        Expected: "abC"
        ```

        It's optional to use `<kbd></kbd>` to get key icons in the keying sequence, but it does add clarity; alternatively, do something like this:

        ```
        Typed: a b shift+C
        ```

        Tip: use key names such as `spacebar` rather than just a space!
