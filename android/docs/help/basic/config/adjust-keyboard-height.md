## Adjust Keyboard Height

This menu is used to adjust the height of the on-screen keyboard (OSK), which does not include the suggestion banner.

Drag the blank OSK at the bottom of the screen to increase or decrease the keyboard height for the device's current orientation (portrait vs landscape). Turn the device 90 degrees to the alternate orientation and repeat the process. The adjusted keyboard heights are automatically saved when the blank OSK is released.

Press the button to reset the OSK height (for the current orientation) to the default device-specific height.
