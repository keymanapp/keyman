title: Does Keyman include adware or spyware?
---

No!

We never have and never will include adware or spyware components. 
Keyman does contact the keyman.com website periodically to check for updates for both Keyman and the keyboards you have installed. 
In this process, the only information communicated is the current version of Keyman and the version of the keyboards.

When [enabling Keyman as a system keyboard](../start/enabling-system-keyboard), Android displays the following warning, which is standard for any system keyboard.
