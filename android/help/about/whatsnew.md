Here are some of the new features we have added to Keyman 15.0 for Android:

* Meet Google Play's target API level requirement of 30 (Android 11)
* Add a settings option to change the displayed keyboard name on the spacebar
* Improve the globe key experience for switching keyboards:
    * Short press and release the globe key to immediately switch to next keyboard
    * Long press and release the globe key to bring up the keyboard picker menu

    Note: On the lock screen, the keyboard picker menu is not displayed.
