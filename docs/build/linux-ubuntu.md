# Setup your Keyman build environment on Ubuntu

## Target Projects

On Linux, you can build the following projects:

* [Keyman for Linux](#keyman-for-linux)
* [Keyman Core](#keyman-core) (Linux only) (aka core)
* [Keyman for Android](#keyman-for-android)
<!-- TODO: document how to build for Web, Core-Wasm and Common/Web on Linux. See TC build agent for details. -->
* Keyman Core (wasm targets)
* Common/Web
* KeymanWeb

The following projects **cannot** be built on Linux:

* Keyman for Windows
* Keyman Developer
* Keyman for macOS
* Keyman for iOS

## System Requirements

* Minimum Ubuntu version: Ubuntu 20.04

Other Linux distributions will also work if appropriate dependencies are installed.

## Repository Paths

Recommended filesystem layout:

```text
$HOME/keyman/
  keyman/              this repository (https://github.com/keymanapp/keyman)
  keyboards/           https://github.com/keymanapp/keyboards
  sites/
    keyman.com/        https://github.com/keymanapp/keyman.com
    ...
```

## Prerequisites

The current list of dependencies can be found in the `Build-Depends` section of `linux/debian/control`.
They are most easily installed with the `mk-build-deps` tool:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install devscripts equivs
sudo mk-build-deps --install linux/debian/control
```

### Node.js

Node.js v18 is required for Core build, Web tests, and Developer command line tools.

## Keyman for Linux

All dependencies are already installed if you followed the instructions under [Prerequisites](#Prerequisites).

Building:

* [Building Keyman for Linux](../../linux/README.md)

## Keyman Core

All dependencies are already installed if you followed the instructions under [Prerequisites](#Prerequisites).

Building:

* [Building Keyman Core](../../core/doc/BUILDING.md)

## Docker Builder

The Docker builder allows you to perform a linux build from anywhere Docker is supported.
To build the docker image:

```shell
cd linux
docker pull ubuntu:latest
docker build . -t keymanapp/keyman-linux-builder:latest
```

Once the image is built, it may be used to build parts of Keyman.

- core

```shell
# build 'core' in docker
cd ../core
# keep linux build artifacts separate
mkdir -p build/linux
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/..:/home/build -v $(pwd)/build/linux:/home/build/core/build keymanapp/keyman-linux-builder:latest bash -c 'core/build.sh --debug'
```

- linux

```shell
# build 'linux' installation in docker
cd keymanapp/keyman
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/home/build/src/keyman -w /home/build/src/keyman keymanapp/keyman-linux-builder:latest bash -c "DESTDIR=. linux/build.sh --debug build install"
```

## Keyman for Android

**Dependencies:**

* [Base](#base-dependencies)
* [Web](./windows#web-dependencies)

**Additional requirements:**

* Android SDK
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install#linux)
* Gradle
* Maven
* OpenJDK 11 (for Keyman 17.0+)
* pandoc

Run Android Studio once after installation to install additional components
such as emulator images and SDK updates.

**Required environment variable:**

* `ANDROID_HOME` pointing to Android SDK (`$HOME/Android/Sdk`)

**Recommended environment variable:**

* [`JAVA_HOME`](#java_home)

Building:

* [Building Keyman for Android](../../android/README.md)

## Prerequisites

Many dependencies are only required for specific projects.

### Base Dependencies

**Environment variables:**

* --

## Notes on Environment Variables

### JAVA_HOME

This environment variable tells Gradle what version of Java to use for building
Keyman for Android. OpenJDK 11 is used for master.

It's recommended to set the environment variables to:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME="[path to OpenJDK 11]"
```

Also edit `/etc/profile.d/jvm.sh` as sudo:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME="[path to OpenJDK 11]"
```

**Multiple versions of Java:** If you need to build Keyman for Android 16.0 or
older versions, you can set `JAVA_HOME_11` to the OpenJDK 11 path and
`JAVA_HOME` to the OpenJDK 8 path. This will build both versions correctly
from command line. But note that you do need to update your `JAVA_HOME` env
var to the associated version before opening Android Studio and loading any
Android projects. `JAVA_HOME_11` is mostly used by CI.
