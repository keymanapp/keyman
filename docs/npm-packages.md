# npm packages

This is a guide for how the various Keyman `npm` packages are developed
and published.

`npm` packages are published on the CI (continuous integration) server.
Currently, we're using TeamCity for this.

Packages are **never** published from a developer's machine.

## List of current published npm packages

* `@keymanapp/common-types` -- located at `common/web/types`
* `@keymanapp/keyman-version` -- located at `common/web/keyman-version`
* `@keymanapp/kmc` -- located at `developer/src/kmc`
* `@keymanapp/kmc-keyboard-info` -- located at `developer/src/kmc-keyboard-unfo`
* `@keymanapp/kmc-kmn` -- located at `developer/src/kmc-kmn`
* `@keymanapp/kmc-ldml` -- located at `developer/src/kmc-ldml`
* `@keymanapp/kmc-model` -- located at `developer/src/kmc-model`
* `@keymanapp/kmc-model-info` -- located at `developer/src/kmc-model-info`

### Deprecated npm packages

* `@keymanapp/developer-lexical-model-compiler` -- replaced by `@keymanapp/kmc`
* `@keymanapp/lexical-model-compiler` -- replaced by `@keymanapp/kmc`
* `@keymanapp/lexical-model-types` -- replaced by `@keymanapp/common-types`

## For CI developers

### In general

Before publishing, a package must be **built** and **tested** on the CI
server.

This is typically done with:

```bash
./build.sh configure build test
```

Once the build succeeds and the tests pass, you can publish! Use the following
script for this (**only on the CI server**!); during this, the version is set in
`package.json`:

```bash
./build.sh publish
```

It is then uploaded to the npm package directory. **Ensure that the compiled
sources are included in the tarball**. For example:

```bash
$ ./build.sh publish
npm notice
npm notice ðŸ“¦  @keymanapp/kmc@16.0.61-alpha-local
npm notice === Tarball Contents ===
npm notice 841B   Makefile

npm notice 449B   tsconfig.kmc-base.json
```

For every release of **Keyman Developer**, the CI publishes a release of
`@keymanapp/kmc`. The version number is locked with the particular version of
Keyman Developer.

### `builder_publish_npm`

Publishes the package in `cwd` to npm

If the `--dry-run` option is available and specified as a command-line
parameter, will do a dry run

Note that `package.json` will be dirty after this command, as the `version`
field will be added to it, and @keymanapp dependency versions will also be
modified. This change should not be committed to the repository.

If --npm-publish is set:
* then builder_publish_npm publishes to the public registry
* else builder_publish_npm creates a local tarball which can be used to test

```bash
  . "$KEYMAN_ROOT/resources/build/build-utils-ci.inc.sh"
  builder_publish_npm
```
