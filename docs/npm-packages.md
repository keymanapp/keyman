# npm packages

This is a guide for how the various Keyman `npm` packages are developed
and published.

`npm` packages are published on the CI (continuous integration) server.
Currently, we're using TeamCity for this.

Packages are **never** published from a developer's machine.

## List of current published npm packages

* `@keymanapp/common-types` -- located at `common/web/types`
* `@keymanapp/keyman-version` -- located at `common/web/keyman-version`
* `@keymanapp/kmc` -- located at `developer/src/kmc`
* `@keymanapp/kmc-keyboard-info` -- located at `developer/src/kmc-keyboard-unfo`
* `@keymanapp/kmc-kmn` -- located at `developer/src/kmc-kmn`
* `@keymanapp/kmc-ldml` -- located at `developer/src/kmc-ldml`

### Deprecated npm packages

## For CI developers

### In general

Before publishing, a package must be **built** and **tested** on the CI
server.

This is typically done with:

```bash
./build.sh configure build test
```

Once the build succeeds and the tests pass, you can publish! Use the following
script for this (**only on the CI server**!); during this, the version is set in
`package.json`:

```bash
./build.sh publish
```

It is then uploaded to the npm package directory. **Ensure that the compiled
sources are included in the tarball**. For example:

```bash
$ ./build.sh publish
npm notice
npm notice ðŸ“¦  @keymanapp/kmc@16.0.61-alpha-local
npm notice === Tarball Contents ===
npm notice 841B   Makefile

npm notice 740B   tsconfig.json
npm notice 449B   tsconfig.kmc-base.json
```

For every release of **Keyman Developer**, the CI publishes a release of
`@keymanapp/kmc`. The version number is locked with the particular version of
Keyman Developer.

### `builder_publish_to_npm`

This helper function updates version numbers and does the publish step for the
package.json in the working directory, using the VERSION_WITH_TAG variable.

```bash
  . "$KEYMAN_ROOT/resources/build/build-utils-ci.inc.sh"
  builder_publish_to_npm
```
