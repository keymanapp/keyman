# npm packages

This is a guide for how the various Keyman `npm` packages are developed
and published.

`npm` packages are published through CI (continuous integration). This is done
through the `.github/workflows/npm-publish.yml` GitHub Action.

Packages are **never** published from a developer's machine.

## List of current published npm packages

* See `resources/build/ci/npm-packages.inc.sh` for an authoritative list.

## For CI developers

### In general

Before publishing, a package must be **built** and **tested**. This is typically
done with:

```bash
./build.sh configure build test
```

Once the build succeeds and the tests pass, you can publish! Add the package to
`resources/build/ci/npm-packages.inc.sh` and it will be published in the next
alpha release build.

It is then uploaded to the npm package directory. **Ensure that the compiled
sources are included in the tarball**. For example:

```bash
$ ./build.sh publish
