# Settings directory

The subdirectories here contain settings files for VSCode that might be helpful to get started.

## Usage

Create a `.vscode` subdirectory in the root `keyman` source directory (i.e. in `../..`) and copy
the relevant settings files there.

Copy the `.devcontainer` directory to the root `keyman` source directory if you
want to use the VSCode [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).
