# Linux packaging

## Package distribution

We use different channels to build and distribute the Linux packages:

- (older version) included in official repos since Ubuntu 19.04 and Debian Buster
- Launchpad repo for [stable](https://launchpad.net/~keymanapp/+archive/ubuntu/keyman),
  [beta](https://launchpad.net/~keymanapp/+archive/ubuntu/keyman-beta) and
  [alpha](https://launchpad.net/~keymanapp/+archive/ubuntu/keyman-alpha) versions
- [pso](http://packages.sil.org/) and [llso](http://linux.lsdev.sil.org/ubuntu/)
  for stable, beta, and alpha versions
- artifacts on [Jenkins](https://jenkins.lsdev.sil.org/view/Keyman/view/Pipeline/job/pipeline-keyman-packaging/view/change-requests/)
  for pull requests

Packages on [llso](http://linux.lsdev.sil.org/ubuntu/) are uploaded automatically and are
intended as a staging environment for testing. Packages on [pso](http://packages.sil.org/)
are uploaded manually after the packages received some testing. End users usually have only
pso enabled.

## Package builds

Package builds happen on [Launchpad](#package-builds-on-launchpad) and
[Jenkins](#package-builds-on-jenkins). Package builds for the official Ubuntu/Debian
repos happen outside of our control. However, we
[upload source packages](#uploading-debian-source-packages) to the Debian community.

## Package builds on Jenkins

### Build jobs

The definition of the packaging jobs, the triggering of the jobs and the necessary build scripts
are scattered over several source repos:

- [ci-builder-scripts](https://github.com/sillsdev/ci-builder-scripts) contains the definition of
  a meta job (multi-branch pipeline job) that gets triggered when a change gets pushed to the
  [Keyman GitHub repo](https://github.com/keymanapp/keyman). The meta job creates a new build
  configuration/job for each branch/pull request on GitHub. The new job gets triggered to initialize
  itself, but then exits immediately. We use the Jenkins
  [Job DSL plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin/wiki) to define the meta job.

  ci-builder-scripts also contains several generic scripts to set up a package build environment
  (using `sbuilder`) and for building source and binary packages. These scripts are shared with
  other projects.

  The Keyman GitHub repo defines a webhook that triggers the meta job on Jenkins.

  Changes to ci-builder-scripts go through [Gerrit](https://gerrit.lsdev.sil.org). See
  [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/sillsdev/ci-builder-scripts/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
  for details.

  File structure:

  - [groovy/KeymanPackagingJobs.groovy](https://github.com/sillsdev/ci-builder-scripts/blob/master/groovy/KeymanPackagingJobs.groovy)
    contains the meta job definition
  - The [bash/](https://github.com/sillsdev/ci-builder-scripts/tree/master/bash) subdirectory
    contains `bash` scripts:

    - [setup.sh](https://github.com/sillsdev/ci-builder-scripts/blob/master/bash/setup.sh) -
      setup sbuild chroot environment
    - [update](https://github.com/sillsdev/ci-builder-scripts/blob/master/bash/update) -
      update the sbuild chroot environment
    - [build-package](https://github.com/sillsdev/ci-builder-scripts/blob/master/bash/build-package) -
      create a binary package

- [lsdev-pipeline-library](https://github.com/sillsdev/lsdev-pipeline-library) contains a reusable
  Jenkins pipeline library. The
  [vars/keymanPackaging.groovy](https://github.com/sillsdev/lsdev-pipeline-library/blob/master/vars/keymanPackaging.groovy)
  file contains the bulk of the logic of the Keyman packaging job.

- The [Keyman GitHub repo](https://github.com/keymanapp/keyman) contains various scripts that are
  used to trigger a build and as part of the package build, and of course the source code for the
  packages:

  - [resources/build/run-required-test-builds.sh](https://github.com/keymanapp/keyman/blob/master/resources/build/run-required-test-builds.sh)
    runs on [TeamCity](https://build.palaso.org/buildConfiguration/Keyman_Test?) to trigger the
    builds for the various platforms, among them the Jenkins package build.
  - [resources/build/increment-version.sh](https://github.com/keymanapp/keyman/blob/master/resources/build/increment-version.sh)
    runs on [TeamCity](https://build.palaso.org/buildConfiguration/Keyman_TriggerReleaseBuildsMaster?)
    and increments the version number before triggering the builds for the various platforms.
  - [linux/Jenkinsfile](https://github.com/keymanapp/keyman/blob/master/linux/Jenkinsfile) is a flag
    for the meta job. If the meta job finds this file, it will create a new build configuration. This
    file simply calls the packaging functionality defined in `lsdev-pipeline-library` and passes the
    distributions and architectures to build as parameters.
  - [linux/build/agent/install-deps](https://github.com/keymanapp/keyman/blob/master/linux/build/agent/install-deps)
    installs dependencies on the current build agent.
  - The [linux/scripts](https://github.com/keymanapp/keyman/tree/master/linux/scripts) subdirectory
    contains `bash` scripts that are used during the package build. Some are only needed for
    Launchpad builds.

    - [jenkins.sh](https://github.com/keymanapp/keyman/blob/master/linux/scripts/jenkins.sh)
      gets called from `lsdev-pipeline-library` to create a source package.

  - [linux/debian](https://github.com/keymanapp/keyman/tree/master/linux/debian) - this is the `debian`
    subdirectory for Keyman for Linux with the meta data for the Linux package.
    See [Debian New Maintainers' Guide](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/) for
    details to the various files.

### Flow of a Linux package build

- TeamCity jobs [Keyman_Test](https://build.palaso.org/buildConfiguration/Keyman_Test) or
  [Keyman_TriggerReleaseBuilds*](https://build.palaso.org/buildConfiguration/Keyman_TriggerReleaseBuildsBeta)
  trigger a build on [Jenkins](https://jenkins.lsdev.sil.org/view/Keyman/view/Pipeline/job/pipeline-keyman-packaging/)
- Jenkins verifies the build parameters and starts the matching build configuration for the PR or
  branch
- The [build job](https://github.com/sillsdev/lsdev-pipeline-library/blob/master/vars/keymanPackaging.groovy) runs several checks:

  - it exits immediately if the build is not manually triggered and no parameters are passed in
    (i.e. it got triggered by the GitHub webhook)
  - it doesn't build if this is a PR, didn't get triggered manually and the PR is not from a trusted
    user
  - it doesn't build if no Linux-relevant files changed unless the parameter `force` was passed
  - manually triggered builds will always build

- build job installs
  [dependencies](https://github.com/keymanapp/keyman/blob/master/linux/build/agent/install-deps)
  on the current build agent
- build job creates a source package for the linux packages (keyman, kmflcomp,
  libkmfl, and ibus-kmfl). This is done by calling
  [scripts/jenkins.sh](https://github.com/keymanapp/keyman/blob/master/linux/scripts/jenkins.sh).
- build job creates the binary package for each linux package on each distribution (currently
  bionic, focal, and groovy) and each architecture (amd64, i386 only for bionic)
- at the end of the build if it is not a build of a PR, the `.deb` file gets uploaded to llso
  (alpha packages to e.g. `bionic-experimental`, beta packages to `bionic-proposed` and
  packages build from the stable branch to the main section `bionic`)
- if the build is successful the job archives the artifacts

The Jenkins build progress is visible in two ways:

- [traditional view](https://jenkins.lsdev.sil.org/view/Keyman/view/Pipeline/job/pipeline-keyman-packaging/)
- [blue ocean view](https://jenkins.lsdev.sil.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/pipeline-keyman-packaging/activity)

**Note:** TC release builds pass the git tag to build to the Jenkins job. The same tag
gets passed twice as parameters `tag` and `tag2`. The first parameter gets persisted between
builds, allowing to retrigger a tag-build. The second parameter is necessary to distinguish
if this is a retriggered build of a tag-build.

### Local package builds

It is possible to use the usual Debian/Ubuntu tools to create the package locally. For someone who
only occasionally deals with packaging it might be easier to use the scripts that Jenkins runs:

#### Prerequisites for local package builds

Install `sbuild` (and probably some other packages that I forgot).

Youâ€™ll need a chroot image before you can use sbuild. The scripts in
[ci-builder-scripts](https://github.com/sillsdev/ci-builder-scripts) will help
with that. [`setup.sh`](https://github.com/sillsdev/ci-builder-scripts/blob/master/bash/setup.sh)
can setup such chroots:

```bash
bash/setup.sh --dists "focal bionic" --arches "amd64 i386"
```

[`update`](https://github.com/sillsdev/ci-builder-scripts/blob/master/bash/update) is used to
later update those chroots:

```bash
bash/update --dists "focal bionic" --arches "amd64 i386"
```

Set the `DEBSIGNKEY` environment variable to your public GPG key that will be used to sign
the packages.

#### Building packages

Building packages happen in the [Keyman source tree](https://github.com/keymanapp/keyman).

The Keyman
[`linux/scripts/jenkins.sh`](https://github.com/keymanapp/keyman/blob/master/linux/scripts/jenkins.sh)
script can be used to create a source package.

```bash
cd linux
./scripts/jenkins.sh keyman ${DEBSIGNKEY}
```

This creates a source package (`keyman_<version>-1.dsc`) and some `*.tar.?z`
files in the source root directory for `keyman`.

ci-builder-script's [`build-package`](https://github.com/sillsdev/ci-builder-scripts/blob/master/bash/build-package)
script creates the binary packages:

```bash
cd $KEYMAN_ROOT
~/ci-builder-scripts/bash/build-package \
    --dists "focal bionic" --arches "amd64 i386" \
    --debkeyid ${DEBSIGNKEY} --build-in-place --no-upload
```

This will create the binary package `keyman_<version>-1+<dist>1_<arch>.deb`.

To speed up package building you might want to limit the build to a single dist
(e.g. `--dists "bionic"`) and arch (e.g. `--arches "amd64"`).

After building packages it might be a good idea to clean up the source tree
before doing further work:

```bash
git clean -dxf
```

### Local package builds (Docker)

It is possible to use the usual Debian/Ubuntu tools to create the package locally.
For someone who only occasionally deals with packaging it might be easier to use
the scripts that run on GitHub actions:

#### Prerequisites for local package builds with Docker

You'll have to create the docker image.

- clone [gha-ubuntu-packaging](https://github.com/sillsdev/gha-ubuntu-packaging)
  repo
- create the image:

  ```bash
  cd /path/to/gha-ubuntu-packaging
  docker build --build-arg DIST=jammy --build-arg PLATFORM=amd64 -t sillsdev/jammy .
  ```

#### Building packages with Docker

- create the source package

  ```bash
  cd $KEYMAN_ROOT
  TIER=$(cat TIER.md)
  export TIER
  cd linux
  ./scripts/deb-packaging.sh source
  ```

  This will create the source package in $KEYMAN_ROOT directory.

- Create the binary packages with Docker:

  ```bash
  cd $KEYMAN_ROOT
  DIST=jammy
  docker run -v $(pwd):/source -i -t -w /source --platform=amd64 \
    --env INPUT_DIST=$DIST --env INPUT_SOURCEPACKAGE=$(ls keyman_*.dsc) \
    --env INPUT_SOURCE_DIR=. sillsdev/$DIST
  ```

  This will create the binary packages in `$KEYMAN_ROOT/artifacts`.

## Package builds on Launchpad

Package builds on Launchpad are triggered manually by running the Keyman script
[linux/scripts/launchpad.sh](https://github.com/keymanapp/keyman/blob/master/linux/scripts/launchpad.sh).

### Prerequisites for Launchpad

1. If you don't have one, create an account at [launchpad.net](https://launchpad.net)
2. Request to join the ["Keyman for Linux"](https://launchpad.net/~keymanapp) team.
3. Create a [GPG](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GnuPrivacyGuardHowto) key
   and associate it to your launchpad account
4. Set the following environment variables in your `~/.profile` or `~/.bashrc`
   (so you don't have to set them every time)

    ```bash
    export GPGKEY=[key_id] # using the `key_id` of your GPG key
    export DEBEMAIL="your.email.address@example.org"
    export DEBFULLNAME="Firstname Lastname"
    ```

### Building packages on Launchpad

The `launchpad.sh` script downloads the current source code (beta or stable) from
[downloads.keyman.com](https://downloads.keyman.com/linux/stable/), creates a
Debian source package and uploads this to launchpad. Launchpad then rebuilds
for the different distros and architectures.

To upload the packages to launchpad, run the following script from the `linux/` directory:

```bash
./scripts/launchpad.sh [UPLOAD="yes"] [TIER="<tier>"] [PROJECT="<project>"] [DIST="<dist>"] [PACKAGEVERSION="<version>"]
```

#### Parameters

- `UPLOAD="yes"` - do the dput for real
- `TIER="<tier>"` - alpha, beta, or stable, default from `../TIER.md`
- `PROJECT="<project>"` - only upload this package
- `DIST="<dist>"` - only upload for this distribution
- `PACKAGEVERSION="<version>"` - normally use the default so don't specify
  it. But if you change packaging and run another upload you need to increment
  the number at the end of `PACKAGEVERSION`. e.g. next one is `1~sil2` then
  `1~sil3`â€¦

### Releasing a new version

As part of releasing a new version it might be good to do some local testing
first before uploading to Launchpad:

- Run `launchpad.sh` with `UPLOAD="no"` to build the packages
- Then install them on a clean VM and make sure no glaring bugs
- Once you are happy with the packages you can run `launchpad.sh` with `UPLOAD="yes"`

### Troubleshooting

Refer to the [launchpad uploading help](https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/PPA/Uploading)
for troubleshooting and setting up for `dput` upload.

## Uploading Debian source packages

Unless you're a Debian maintainer you can't directly upload to the Debian repos.
Instead you upload to <mentors.debian.net> and then look for a sponsor who will
review the packages and upload them for you. Be prepared that this might take some
persistence, and if somebody looks at it, it might take some iterations to get it
accepted.

The Keyman packages are maintained on the Debian side by the
[Debian Input Method Team](https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/IMEPackagingTeam).

**NOTE:** All `changelog` files should contain the exact same entry that was
previously accepted into the Debian repo (plus the new entry for the new
update). This means that when your upload got accepted into Debian (not
<mentors.debian.net>) you'll have to update the `changelog` files to match
what got accepted (sometimes the Debian maintainers will create additional
package versions).

### Prerequisites

- an account on [mentors.debian.net](https://mentors.debian.net/accounts/register/)
- an entry for `mentors` in your `.dput.cf` file:

  ```bash
  [mentors]
  fqdn = mentors.debian.net
  incoming = /upload
  method = https
  allow_unsigned_uploads = 0
  progress_indicator = 2
  # Allow uploads for UNRELEASED packages
  allowed_distributions = .*
  ```

- subscribe to the [debian-input-method](https://lists.debian.org/debian-input-method/)
  mailing list

### Updating and uploading a stable release to Debian

To do this you can run the `linux/scripts/upload-to-debian.sh` script:

```bash
linux/scripts/upload-to-debian.sh -k ${DEBSIGNKEY} --push
```

This does several steps:

1. Download the source code from <download.keyman.com> and create the source
   package by running `scripts/debian.sh`
2. sign the source package
3. upload to mentors (unless `-n` is passed)
4. Create a branch with the updated `linux/debian/changelog` file based on the
   stable branch
5. Cherry-pick the change on a new branch based on `master`
6. If `--push` is passed, the two branches will be pushed to GitHub

There are a few additional manual required steps:

1. Create a draft-PR for the change against stable branch
2. Create a draft PR for the cherry-picked change against `master`
3. file a RFS bug (Request For Sponsorship) against the `sponsorship-requests`
   pseudo-package, cc'ing `debian-input-method`, or just send an email to the
   `debian-input-method` list.

After the package got published in Debian you can mark the PRs as ready
for review. This should only be done after the package got published in
Debian because the changelog file needs to contain the exact same
information that the changelog in Debian has.
