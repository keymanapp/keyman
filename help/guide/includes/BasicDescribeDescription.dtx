  * Description section *
  The description section is an extensive description of the symbol. Use as many sentences and
  paragraphs as needed to fully explain the purpose of the symbol. If the description gets to long
  (more than a single page) consider using an "additional info" group to put all the information in
  and reduce the symbol description so it fits on a single page. Also add a specific line stating
  where additional info can be found (e.g. "For additional information see the \<LINK
  AddInfoExample, additional information example\>" where the AddInfoExample is the name of the
  symbol or group that contains the additional information you want to refer to).
