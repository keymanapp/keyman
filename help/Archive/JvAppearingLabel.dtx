Summary
  Label that flies onto the form.
Description
  TJvAppearingLabel is a label descendant that is able to let the label fly onto the form. The label
  can be set to appear from the top, right, bottom or left side of the screen. The appearing
  sequence is handled in a background thread which makes it possible to have multiple labels
  appearing at the same time.

  When the label has appeared, the OnAppeared event is called.
  
  To use an appearing label you should execute these tasks:

  * Drop a TJvAppearingLabel control on the form.
  * Specify <LINK TJvAppearingLabel.AppearFrom, from which direction> the label is to appear.
  * Specify if the label should <LINK TJvAppearingLabel.AutoStart, appear immediately> after the
    label is created.
  * Specify the <LINK TJvAppearingLabel.FirstInterval, initial delay> before the item should start
    to appear.
  * Specify the <LINK TJvAppearingLabel.Interval, delay between two movements>.
  * Specify the <LINK TJvAppearingLabel.ScrollPixel, number of pixels to move> each time.
  * Optionally assign an OnAppeared event handler to be notified when the label is in it's final
    (design time) location.

  False, as it gives you the possibility to start the sequence manually.
