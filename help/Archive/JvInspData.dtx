Summary
  Base inspector data class.
Description
  TJvCustomInspectorData is the abstract base data class. It's
  the interface between the inspector and the data it inspects.
  The base class provides properties and method to access the
  data in various forms (much like a TField).

  In addition, each data class can have it's own item
  registration database. This will provide a way to register
  different types based on the metadata the data instance can
  provide.

  given parameters already exists, the item will be attached to that data instance, instead of
  creating a new data instance.
  
  TJvInspectorPropData implements New to allow various ways of adding properties:

  * Specifying a parent, an instance and property info record (PPropInfo) to add a single property.
  * Specifying a parent, an instance and a list of property info records (PPropList) to add multiple
    properties at a time. For each property a new item is generated, which is returned in the dynamic
    array.
  * Specifying a parent, an instance and property type(s) to add all properties of (a) certain type(s)
    at once. For each property a new item is generated, which is returned in the dynamic array.

  If you want to specify a list of names to include or exclude, use the NewByNames method.

  It is possible that with some parameters no items are generated, which will result in an empty
  dynamic array.
Parameters
  AParent -       The parent to which this data should be added.
  AInstance -     TObject instance that provides the property values.
  PropInfo -      Property Info record, obtained by a call to GetPropInfo.

@@TJvInspectorEventData
Summary
  Event based data layer.
Description
  TJvInspectorEventData is the inspector data layer that obtains it's data
  through event handlers. Use this data layer if there is no data layer
  available to access a specific data source. Note that it's often more
  efficient to write a new data layer for specific data sources, as you can more
  precisely control how various type kinds are to be accessed and/or translated.
  The class implements all access properties, but the type info will be used to
  check the legality of the access (ie. a float can't be accessed as Int64).

  After creating an instance of this data layer, you should assign handlers to
  those events that can be used (eg. if the data can only be accessed as
  strings, it's enough to assign an OnGetAsString and an OnSetAsString event).

@@TJvInspectorCustomConfData.ExistingValue
Summary
  Indicates wether the specified section and key exist.
Description
  ExistingValue determines wether or not the section/key pair is an actual value
  within the configuration file/settings database.

  Descendants must override this method to provide a meaningfull result. The
  implementation of <LINK TJvCustomInspectorData.IsAssigned, IsAssigned> uses the result of this
  method.

@@TJvInspectorCustomConfData.Key
Summary
  The key this instance represents.
Description
  Key holds the key name within the section specified by Section in the
  configuration file/settings database.

  Section
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvInspectorCustomConfData.ReadValue
Summary
  Reads a string value.
Description
  ReadValue reads the string value from the configuration file/settings database
  where the Section/Key pair is pointing to.

  Descendants should override this method to read the value represented by the
  Section/Key pair from the configuration file/settings database.

  Key, Section, WriteValue
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvInspectorCustomConfData.Section
Summary

  Key
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvInspectorCustomConfData.WriteValue
Summary
  Writes a string value.
Description
  WriteValue writes the string value to the configuration file/settings database
  where the Section/Key pair is pointing to.

  Descendants should override this method to write the value to the
  configuration file/settings database at the location represented by the
  Section/Key pair.

## Data layers: INI file data layer
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvInspectorINIFileData
Summary
  INI file data layer.
Description
  TJvInspectorINIFileData is the inspector data layer that obtains it's
  data from a TCustomIniFile descendant. As the class is derived from
  TJvInspectorCustomConfData, all access properties are implemented, but the type
  info will be used to check the legality of the access (ie. a float can't be
  accessed as Int64). <B>Note:</B> you can change the type info pointer of the
  data layer instance. This can be useful to provide alternative enumeration
  constants (including names with spaces) by using the JclRTTI unit and it's
  JclGenerateEnumType function.

  The data layer implements ExistingValue, ReadValue and WriteValue and provides
  an additional property to hold a reference to the INI-file object.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvInspectorINIFileData.New
Summary
  Instantiate a data instance and attaches an item to it.
Description
  New instantiates a new data instance with the given parameters. If the data referred to by the
  given parameters already exists, the item will be attached to that data instance, instead of
  creating a new data instance.
  
  Depending on which overloaded method is called, the ini file will be scanned for sections and/or
  keys to instantiate. For each section/key combination a check is made to see if the instance is
  unique. If it already exists, the pre-existing data instance is used and a new item is added to
  it.
  
  Using the events you can prevent certain keys being created or even prevent whole sections being
  scanned. In addition, these events allow you to change the name for the new item instance as well
  as which type info to attach to it.
Parameters
  AParent - The parent to which this data should be added.
  AName - The display name of the item.
  ASection - Section within the configuration file/settings database.
  AKey - Key within the section of the configuration file/settings database.
  ATypeInfo - Type info pointer to use.
  AINIFile - TCustomIniFile derivative to be used as a data source.
  OnAddSection - Event that will be called before a section is about to be
                  parsed. If no event is supplied, all sections are parsed,
                  leaving the section name as the category name.
  OnAddKey - Event that will be called before a key is added. If no event is
              supplied, all keys are added, leaving the key name as the display
              name and the type info pointer set to string.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvInspectorINIFileData.INIFile
Summary
  Reference to the INI-file object.
Description
  INIFile holds a reference to the INI-file object linked to the data instance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Data layers: Database data layer
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvInspectorDBData
Summary
  database data layer.
Description
  TJvInspectorDBData is the inspector data layer that obtains it's data from a
  TDataSource/TField. The class implements all access properties, but the type
  info will be used to check the legality of the access (ie. a float can't be
  accessed as Int64). <B>Note:</B> you can change the type info pointer of the
  data layer instance. This can be useful to provide alternative enumeration
  constants (including names with spaces) by using the JclRTTI unit and it's
  JclGenerateEnumType function.

  The data layer provides it's own item registration database as well as a
  FieldType to RTTI mapping database. The FieldType mapping database is
  pre-filled with items to convert TFieldType values to a proper RTTI pointer.
  These items do not provide an inspector item class, which is left to the
  item registration database.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvInspectorDBData.New
Summary
  Instantiate a data instance and attaches an item to it.
Description
  New instantiates a new data instance with the given parameters. If the data referred to by the
  given parameters already exists, the item will be attached to that data instance, instead of
  creating a new data instance.
  
  New data instances are generated with DisplayName initialized to the DisplayName of the given
  field and TypeInfo initialized to the type info found in the FieldType mapping database. If no
  mapping is found there, no item will be created for it.

  Depending on the overloaded method called, multiple items could be created. All of them are
  returned in the resulting dynamic array.
Parameters
  AParent -       The parent to which this data should be added.
  ADataSource -   The data source that is to provide the data.
  AFieldName -    Name of the field to create an instance for.
  AFieldNames -   List of fields to create instances for.

@@TJvInspectorDBData.DataSource
Summary
  Reference to the TDataSource that provides the data.
Description
  DataSource is a reference to a TDataSource that will provide the data for the
  item. Read DataSource to find out the currently used TDataSource or set it to
  a new TDataSource.

  When setting the DataSource property when a field had already been selected,
  the field will be searched in the new data source, based on the field's name.
  If the field does not exist, the Field and FieldName property will be set to
  <B>nil</B> and an empty string respectively.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvInspectorDBData.FieldTypeMapping
Summary
  FieldType to RTTI mapping database.
Description
  FieldTypeMapping is a registration database to maps a field's DataType value
  to a proper RTTI pointer. The list is prefilled to map the basic TFieldType
  values to a RTTI pointer. In addition, new items can be added to override the
  default mapping, or provide additional mapping values.
Note
  Although FieldTypeMapping holds an instance of TJvInspectorRegister, it is not
  possible to check a parents database, since that mechanisme will always use a
  data layers ItemRegister function. If you do declare a descendant data layer
  with it's own mapping, you should create a TJvInspectorRegister instance for
  the TJvCustomInspectorData data layer. Inside the FieldTypeMapping method you
  can then call the ancestor's FieldTypeMapping if the derived database results
  in a mismatch.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvInspectorDBData.InitDB
Summary
  Initializes the data-aware part of the data layer.
Description
  InitDB initializes the data-aware part of the data layer. InitDB takes the
  following actions:
  * If a data link has not yet been created, InitDB wil create one.
  * The DataSource and FieldName properties will be initialized.
  * The FieldTypeMapping database will be searched for an RTTI pointer. The
    pointer will be returned in the ATypeInfo parameter.
Parameters
  ADataSource - DataSource to use for the layer.
  AFieldName - Name of field to link to.
  ATypeInfo - Variable to receive the RTTI pointer in. If no RTTI pointer was
                found in the mapping database, the variable will be set to
                <B>nil</B>.
