@@TJvZoom.ZoomInAt
Summary
  Zooms in at a specific location
Description
  Use ZoomInAt to zoom in at a specific part of the screen. The X and Y parameters determine the top
  and left edges of the area to zoom.
  
  Note that this method works differently depending on the state of the Enabled property: if Enabled
  is true, the mouse cursor is moved to the specified location to create the zoomed image. If Enabled
  is false, the mouse cursor is not moved.
Parameters
  X - The horizontal screen coordinate
  Y - The vertical screen coordinate

  TJvZoom.Active, TJvZoom.Enabled

@@TJvZoom.Enabled
Summary
  Controls whether the control responds to mouse, keyboard, and timer events.
Description
  Enabled works the same in this control as it does in most other with one additional feature: you
  can set Enabled to false to manually control the zoom action. When Enabled is false, you can take
  screenshots without moving the mouse by calling the ZoomInAt method. When Enabled is true,
  screenshots are taken automatically based on the current location of the mouse cursor.
