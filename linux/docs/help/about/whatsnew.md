title: What's New in Keyman 18.0 for Linux
---

Here are some significant changes to Keyman for Linux 18.0:

- Minimum supported Ubuntu version is now 22.04 Jammy LTS.
- Other supported versions are Ubuntu 24.04 Noble LTS and
  Ubuntu 24.10 Oracular. Users that are running an older version of
  Ubuntu will have to continue using an older Keyman version.
- Keyman no longer requires a patched version of ibus as Keyman now uses
  a system service to manage keystroke order (#11535).
- Added support for simulation of AltGr (right Alt) with Ctrl+Alt (#11852)
