  <summary>Keyman input method for IBus</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
     This input method provides the Keyman IM engine for IBus. With this module, you can
     use keyboard layouts designed for Keyman under the IBus platform.
   </p>
   <p>
     Originally created in 1993 to type Lao on Windows, Keyman is now a free and
     open source keyboarding platform which allows anyone to write a keyboard layout
     for their language. Keyman is available for many platforms, including Windows,
     macOS, iOS, Android, Linux and the web.
   </p>
   <p>
     Keyboard layouts are defined with a clear and easy to understand keyboard
     grammar. Keyman's contextual input model means keyboard layouts can be
     intelligent and make it simple to type even the most complex languages.
     Keyboard layouts are distributed through an open catalog to all major desktop
     and mobile platforms.
   </p>
   <p>
      Input methods are typing systems allowing users to input complex languages.
