​  <summary>KMFL input method for IBus</summary>
​  <description>
​    <p>
      This package provides the KMFL (Keyboard Mapping for Linux) input method
      engine for IBus. With this module, you can use keyboard layouts designed
      for Keyman for Windows 6.0 under the IBus platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Originally created in 1993 to type Lao on Windows, Keyman is now a free and
      open source keyboarding platform which allows anyone to write a keyboard layout
      for their language. Keyman is available for many platforms, including Windows,
      macOS, iOS, Android, Linux and the web.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keyboard layouts are defined with a clear and easy to understand keyboard
      grammar. Keyman's contextual input model means keyboard layouts can be
      intelligent and make it simple to type even the most complex languages.
      Keyboard layouts are distributed through an open catalog to all major desktop
      and mobile platforms.

​      Input methods are typing systems allowing users to input complex languages.
