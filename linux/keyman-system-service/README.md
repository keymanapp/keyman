A DBus system service that allows to access /dev/input/* devices
to toggle capslock and perform other keyboard related actions when
running under Wayland.

## Notes

- If we need to limit access to the interface to only Keyman, we can use
  [polkit](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/polkit/docs/latest/polkit.8.html)
  which allows to add a rule with an action that checks for the program.

- to see the log file

  ```bash
  journalctl -f -u systemd-keyman
  ```

- to monitor method calls

  ```bash
  sudo busctl monitor com.keyman.SystemService1
  ```
