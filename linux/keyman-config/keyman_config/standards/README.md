# About the standards data files in this folder

- `lang_tags_map.py`

This file is generated by `buildtools/build-langtags.py` during the standard build process.
It should not be included in the repo. `build-langtags.py` itself uses the standards data files in
`<keyman.git>/resources/standards-data/`.

See the readme.md in that folder for processes for updating the data files.
