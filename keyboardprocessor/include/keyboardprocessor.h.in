# Keyman Keyboard Processor API

## Requirements
1. Cross platform.
2. Cross language.
3. Facilitate stateless operation of the Engine.
4. Keyboard format agnostic -- support both KMN and future LDML based keyboards.
5. Support querying Engine attributes.
6. Support querying Keyboard attributes.
7. Idempotent


## Design decisions in support of requirements:
- Use C or C99 types and calling convention for the interface, it has the
  broadest language FFI support. [1,2]
- Have client (platform glue) code load keyboards, manage & pass state. [3,4,7]
- Provide query calls to return static attributes data for keyboards and
  engine [5,6]
- Provide get/set calls for client accessible keyboard state information [3,4]


## Glossary
- __Platform layer:__
the code that consumes the Keyman Keyboard Processor API, and provides the
operating system-specific handling of keystroke events and integration with
applications.
- __Client Application:__
the application that has the focus and receives text events from the Platform
layer.
- __Context:__ Text preceding the insertion point
- __Marker:__ Positional state that can be placed in the Context.
- __Keyboard:__ A set of rules for execution my an Engine
- __Option:__ A variable in a dynamic or static key value store.
- __Processor:__
The component that implements this API and  can parse and execute a particular
keyboard.
- __State:__ An object that hold internal state of the Processor for a given
insertion point
- __Action:__
A directive output by the processor detailing how the Platform layer should
transform the Client Application's text buffer. There may be several items
produced by a single keyboard event.
- __Keyboard Event:__
A virtual key board event and modifier map recevied from the platform to be
processed with the state object for this Client application.

All calls, types and enums are prefixed with the namespace identifier `km_kbp_`

### Error Handling
Error handling and success failure notification are communicated through a
general mechanism similar to COM’s `HRESULT` scheme. Any functions that can
fail will always return a status value and all results are returned via
outparams passed to the function.
```c
*/
enum km_kbp_status_codes {
  KM_KBP_STATUS_OK = 0,
  KM_KBP_STATUS_NO_MEM = 1,
  KM_KBP_STATUS_IO_ERROR = 2,
  KM_KBP_STATUS_INVALID_ARGUMENT = 3,
  KM_KBP_STATUS_KEY_ERROR = 4,
  KM_KBP_STATUS_OS_ERROR = 0x80000000
};

/*
```
The final status code KM_KBP_STATUS_OS_ERROR is intended to allow encapsulating
a platform error code, the remaining 31 low bits are the error code returned by
the OS for case where the failure mode is platform specific. For HRESULT codes
this only permits failure codes to be passed.


### Context
The context is the text to the left of the insertion point (caret, cursor).
The context is constructed by the Platform layer, typically by interrogating the
Client Application.  The context will be updated by the engine for keystroke
events.  If the Platform layer code caches the context, the context should be
reset when a context state change is detected. Context state changes can occur
when the user uses the mouse to move the insertion point, uses cursor keys,
switches applications or input fields, or presses hotkeys such as Ctrl+N to
start a new document. The full set of context state change triggers is up to the
Platform layer.

Context can also contain positional Markers (also known as 'deadkeys' in kmn
keyboards), which are transitory state flags that are erased whenever a context
state change is detected. Markers are always controlled by the Engine.

Contexts are always owned by their state.  They maybe set to a list of
context_items or interrogated for their current list of context items.

### Action Items

be processed by the Platform layer to issue commands to the platform text
services framework to acheive the expected effect.
```c
*/
typedef struct {

  uint8_t   __reserved[3];

    uintptr_t           marker;     // MARKER type

  KM_KBP_IT_MAX_TYPE_ID
};


/*
```
### Options
A state’s default options are set from the keyboard at creation time and the
environment. The Platform layer is then is expected to apply any persisted
options it is maintaining.  Options are passed into and out of API functions as
simple C arrays of `km_kbp_option` terminated with a `KM_KBP_OPTIONS_END`
sentinel value. A state's options are exposed and manipulatable via the
`km_kbp_options_set` API. All option values are of type C string.

During processing when the glue code finds a PERSIST action type it should
store the updated option in the appropriate place, based on it's scope.
For RESET the processor will apply the pristine value from the original scope,
the Platform layer should update that only if it manages a previously persisted
value.
