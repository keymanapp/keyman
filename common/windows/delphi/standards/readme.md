# About the standards data files in this folder

* Keyman.System.Standards.BCP47SuppressScriptRegistry.pas
* Keyman.System.Standards.ISO6393ToBCP47Registry.pas
* Keyman.System.Standards.WindowsToBCP47.pas

These files are generated by `common/windows/tools/build_standards_data` during the standard build process. They should
not be included in the repo. `build_standards_data` itself uses the standards data files in `<keyman.git>/resources/standards-data/`.
See the readme.md in that folder for processes for updating the data files.
