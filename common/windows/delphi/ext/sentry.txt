Installation notes
------------------

The original C++ version can be downloaded from site above, and must be
built following the instructions below.

Build notes
-----------

sentry.pas is a conversion of sentry.h currently maintained by the Keyman
team. This needs to be updated whenever Sentry is updated.

Sentry.Client.pas is a wrapper of sentry.pas which provides a Delphi-style
interface to Sentry.

Note: as of 0.6.0, performance SDKs are not included in Sentry.Client.pas,
because we are not currently using them.

build_sentry_for_keyman.bat should be copied into the sentry-native repo,
and tweaked as required for updated versions of Sentry. Run:

  build_sentry_for_keyman configure build install deploy

  configure: setup build environment
  build: build x86 and x64 libraries
  install: prepare install folder in sentry-native
  deploy: copy the sentry.dll and related files into this repo

**Important:** ensure that the sentry folder name in all .wxs files is
updated to match the SENTRY_SDK_VERSION from sentry.h. Source C++ and .pas
files use the constant to refer to the location where the files may be
found.
