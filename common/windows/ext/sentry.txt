Build notes
-----------

sentry.pas is a conversion of sentry.h currently maintained by the Keyman
team. This needs to be updated whenever Sentry is updated.

Sentry.Client.pas is a wrapper of sentry.pas which provides a Delphi-style
interface to Sentry.

build_sentry_for_keyman.bat should be copied into the sentry-native repo,
and tweaked as required for updated versions of Sentry. Run:

  build_sentry_for_keyman configure build install deploy

  configure: setup build environment
  build: build x86 and x64 libraries
  install: prepare install folder in sentry-native
  deploy: copy the sentry.dll and related files into this repo
