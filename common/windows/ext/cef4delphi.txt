Installation notes
------------------

Copy the source/ and packages/ folders from the CEF4Delphi repository
into the windows/src/ext/cef4delphi folder. Ensure that the
CEF4Delphi_binary repository is kept in sync with the cef4delphi source
version.

Build and notes
---------------

Cef4Delphi also requires the CEF binary distribution from
https://www.spotify.com/au/opensource/, cloned at
https://github.com/keymanapp/CEF4Delphi_binary. Build agents will
source this repository in order to build the installer for
of Keyman Developer. On a development machine, clone the
CEF4Delphi_binary repository and set the registry value
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Keyman\Debug] Debug_CEFPath [REG_SZ] to
the root of the cloned repo in order to run Keyman Developer.

Note that some of the files in the CEF4Delphi_binary repo are larger
than 100MB, which GitHub does not handle, so they have been zipped.
buildtools/cef-checkout.sh will extract them during a release build, but
for development use, you'll need to extract them yourself.

Debug symbols for CEF can be found at:
https://cef-builds.spotifycdn.com/index.html#windows32

Note that these symbols are too large to upload to sentry.keyman.com;
instead, it should be possible to upload them to downloads.keyman.com
using symsrv.
