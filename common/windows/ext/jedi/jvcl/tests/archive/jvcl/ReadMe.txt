JEDI VCL 2.10 for D5-D7 
(http://jvcl.sourceforge.net)

The JEDI Visual Component Library (JVCL) for D5-D7 consists of a set of visual components which can be instantly reused in your Delphi  projects.

The library is built upon code donated from the JEDI community. Please note that this is a beta release, and as such, there is still a lot of work to do. There has been a significant merging/refactoring since version 2.0 and this means, among other things, that some components have disappeared and others have been equipped with new capabilities. Please read restruct_changelog.txt, restruct_demochanges.txt and ChangeLog20to21.txt for details on what has changed since the last release and to give you a hint on how to move your code from 2.0 to 2.1. Your involvement and help in improving JVCL and finding bugs would be very much appreciated.

JVCL is released to the public under the terms of the Mozilla Public License (MPL) and as such can be freely used in both freeware/shareware, opensource and commercial projects. The MPL does have a few restrictions and we urge you to read the MPL (at http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html) and MPL FAQ documents available in the JCL-Help.chm file.

- Contents of the JEDI Visual Component Library

\Archive 
Older components that have been removed from JVCL. If you have projects that still use them, that's were you'll find them.

\Bin
Output folder for EXE files generated by the examples. NOTE that some of the examples rely on the EXE to be in the same folder as the example file(s). Move the EXE to the original folder if you encounter errors when running a demo.

\Common
This directory contains units that are or might be shared among different JEDI projects

\Convert
Conversion utility to rename units/file content. Initialiiy used to convert RxLib to JVCL naming standars but can be used for any type of file/file content renaming

\devtools
Various application that might be useful for other developers

\Packages
Contains the package files needed for JVCL installation

\Help
Contains the JVCL Helpfile. This helpfile is currently incomplete. 

\Images
All component palette images in BMP and PNG format

\Examples
Contains example projects demonstrating some of the components in the JVCL. 

\lib5
Output folder for DCU files when compiling for Dephi 5

\lib6
Output folder for DCU files when compiling for Dephi 6 or Delphi 6 Personal

\lib7
Output folder for DCU files when compiling for Dephi 7 or Delphi 7 Personal

\Resources
All *.DCR files containing JVCL glyphs required for Delphi installation

\Source
This directory contains all the source code units for the JEDI VCL.


NOTE: to compile all examples at once, just run the "CompileExamples.bat" batch file. The JVCL has to be a SIBLING subdirectory to JCL (on the same level) for this to succeed. 


INSTALLATION
=============
Please see the file "Install.txt"

CHANGES
=======
Please read the Changelog.txt file in \source to find out what has changed since the previous release.

FUTURE PLANS / NOT FINISHED:
============================

- This release contains a number of duplicate components, since the merging of new libraries into JVCL isn't complete. Please report any suggestions and findings in the Issue Tracker to speed up this process. 

- If you have existing code using JVCL 2.00 or earlier, you might have to rename and remove units and components. Use the restructure_changelog.txt as a guide to where things are located currently. If anything is missing from restructure_changelog.txt, please let us know by posting in the Issue Tracker

- Since it is hard to tell up front what will stay and what will disappear, here's a couple of hints on how you should use the components to minimize the risk of having to redo it in the future:

- If a component/unit doesn't have a TJv/Jv prefix (i.e it has a TJvx/Jvx or TJva/Jva or similar) it is an indication that it came from a new library and that it somehow duplicates something already in JVCL (even if it's only the name). Try finding the JVCL equivalent and compare: if there is a similar component, you can be pretty sure that the current JVCL name will be used even if the properties, events and methods of the duplicate component *might* be added to the JVCL component

- If we merge these components, the TJvx/TJva component will be placed in the Archive, so you will have the option to switch to the new JVCL component, or  use the TJvx/TJva version from Archive

- Your safest bet is to stay away from any "suspect" components in production code and use the "old" version instead

- There is an ongoing effort to remove duplicates from JVCL that are already in JCL (mostly functions, but some classes are also involved). If you find anything that you think should be moved from JVCL to JCL, please report in the Issue tracker.

- The support for Delphi 6 and 7 Personal should now be functional. Please report any problems in the Issue Tracker.
