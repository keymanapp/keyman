Known Issues:

 Versionhistory:

 BaseVersion 5 :
 V 11 : When loading packages -> except instead of finally -> //!11
        New event : OnErrorLoading
 V 10 : Now handles custom Plugins (only their destructors are called when unloading)
 V 09 : Pluginmanager : Extension automatically follows plugintype
        First version to share with "rest of the world"
 V 08 : Problems with $ImplicitBuild
 V 07 : fixed file-creation bug: linebreaks were done with #10#13 instead of
              the other way round, what caused the IDE-navigation do show
              erroneous behaviour
 V 06 : fixed Memory leak when loading of not supported DLL's is skipped
        inserted credits to About-box
 V 05 : started adding Package-functionality
        PluginManager : Loined 2 TLists to one,
        Record with info on Plugins introduced
        fixed buggy Instance-count check
        Added PluginKind-Property
        changed : PluginName also contains path
 V 04 : cleaned Plugin-Manager :
        Removed OnBefore- and OnAfterLoading (REALLY unnecessary - OnBeforeLoad,
                and OnAfterLoad are still here !)
        Removed Trigger-routines. Were only called once -> moved into code
 V 03 : removed unecessary Set/Get-routines for most properties
 V 02 : new about-dialog, removed unnecessary CDK-auto-generated comments
        stupid fPluginHandles from TStringList -> TList
 V 01 : renamed objects, files, ressources
        fixed several Memory-leaks, fixed unload-bug, minimized uses-list
