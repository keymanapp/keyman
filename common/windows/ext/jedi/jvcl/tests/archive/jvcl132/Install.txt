Install notes for JEDI-VCL (JVCL) Version 1.32 for Delphi 5/Delphi 6
==================================================

1) IMPORTANT - in order to use JVCL, you need to have JCL (JEDI Code Library) INSTALLED on your computer. JCL is available from http://sourceforge.net/projects/jcl/

Please follow their instructions for installation (you should not have installed the DJCL package in the Delphi IDE)

2) Unzip the JVCL files to a subdirectory of your choice (IMPORTANT: it should be a sibling to the JCL subdirectory, i.e. it is on the same level as JCL:

- JCL
- JVCL

3) In Delphi open the appropriate design package that is in the "Packages" subdirectory. 
    a) for Delphi 6 it's "JVCL100_D60.dpk" 
    b) for Delphi 6 Personal it's "JVCL100_D60Personal.dpk"
    c) for Delphi 5 it's "JVCL100_D50.dpk" 


4) Click on the "Compile" button, and then on "Install" button

If you get compile error stating that zlib.pas, or some *.obj files are missing, please make sure that in your packages following paths:

$(DELPHI)\source\extras\zlib\
$(DELPHI)\source\extras\zlib\obj

are in your Search path ( click on package Options, and then on "Directories" tab)

Of course, you need to install those files from Delphi first. If the EXTRAS subdirectory doesn't exist, please install the files from your Delphi CD.



5) The window showing all the components that have been installed will be very big, and most probably you won't see the "OK" button, so just close the window. You should have JVCL installed on your PC.
