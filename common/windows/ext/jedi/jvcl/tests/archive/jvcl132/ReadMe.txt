JEDI VCL for D5/D6 (Ver. 1.32 Final)
(http://jvcl.sourceforge.net)

The JEDI-VCL (JVCL) consists of a set of over 300 visual components which can be instantly reused in your D5/D6 projects.

The library is built upon code donated from the JEDI community. Please note that this is a beta release, and as such, there is a lot of work to do. We are also aware that there is overlap between some components, and we should refactor/merge them. Your involvement and help in improving JVCL would be very much appreciated.

JVCL is released to the public under the terms of the Mozilla Public License (MPL) and as such can be freely used in both freeware/shareware, opensource and commercial projects. The MPL does have a few restrictions and we urge you to read the MPL (at http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html) and MPL FAQ documents available in the JCL-Help.chm file.
