=========================================
-- InspectorItem.SelectValue() 
   Added "If SL.Count>0" check to ensure no infinite loop occurs when no items are in the list
-- InspectorItem.SetEditCtrl()
   Reset Window Proc to old window proc before freeing the Old Edit Ctrl because I was getting a weird access violation when I tabbed too fast and tabbing was on. (Deepak Shenoy)
Note: have to consider reusing? Or somehow allowing custom call in at this point.
-- InspectorItem.DrawValue()
   Added the "If Data=nil" check at the beginning because sometimes we were getting data=nil (??)
=========================================
