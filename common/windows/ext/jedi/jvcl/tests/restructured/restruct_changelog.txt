Other notes:
============
--> JvBMPListBox doesn't seem to work too well: resizing leaves "smears" both at DT and RT.
    No solution found. 
--> JvAutoSizeCompo should really be named JvAutoSizer or something: it resizes the components when the form changes size
    Don't know how useful this is now when we have Anchors and Constraints?
--> JvFormPlace should be named JvFormPosSave or something.
    It should also have a property to specify where in the registry to save (this is hard-coded now).
    Also, should be possible to rewrite to use only one for an entire application (now you need one for each form)
--> TJvFavoritesButton,TJvStartMenuBtn,TJvRecentMenuBtn and TJvControlPanel should really either be popup menu components or procedures
    returning a list of the items in each list
--> TJvControlPanel crashes on my computer (Win2k)
--> TJvControlPanel should be renamed TJvControlPanelButton 
--> TJvDirectories should be renamed TJvSystemDirectories
