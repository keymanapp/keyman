@@TJvOwnerDrawViewerOptions.VertSpacing

@@TJvOwnerDrawViewerOptions.Tracking
Summary
  Determines whether the scroll box moves before the thumb tab is released.
Description
  Use Tracking to control whether the scrollbar and associated control repaint while the thumb tab is
  dragged with the mouse. If Tracking is True, the images moves as the user drags the thumb tab. If
  Tracking is False, the image remains static until the thumb tab is released.
  
  Repainting while the thumb tab is dragged can provide useful feedback to the user about how far the
  control has scrolled, but slows performance.

@@TJvOwnerDrawViewerOptions.ShowCaptions
Summary
  Specifies whether captions should be shown or not.
Description
  Set ShowCaptions to true to adjust the TRects passed to OnDrawItem to make room for a caption.
  
  Since the owner draw viewer doesn't have its own Caption, it is up to you to draw the text of each
  item in the OnDrawItem.

@@TJvOwnerDrawViewerOptions.Smooth
Summary
  Specifies whether the amount the associated control scrolls is dynamically computed.
Description
  Set Smooth to True to specify that the scroll bar should dynamically adjust its scrolling increment
  based on the size of the associated control’s client area.
  
  When Smooth is True, clicking the end arrows of the scrollbar scrolls the associated control by
  approximately one tenth of its client area, and clicking the scrollbar beside the thumb tab scrolls
  the control by the length of the client area minus the amount scrolled by the end arrows. When
  Smooth is False, the Increment property controls the amount of scrolling when the user clicks the
  end arrows, and clicking beside the thumb tab scrolls the control by the entire length of the
  client area.

@@TJvOwnerDrawViewerOptions.ScrollBar
Summary
  Determines how items are arranged in the control.
Description
  Use ScrollBar to determine how items are arranged in the control and which scroll bar is shown when
  the items don't fit in the current ClientRect. When ScrollBar is tvHorizontal, the control displays
  as many rows as possible and determines the number of columns based on the number of rows. If all
  items can't fit into the current ClientRect, a horizontal scrollbar is displayed.
  
  When ScrollBar is tvVertical, the control displays as many columns as possible and determines the
  number of rows based on this value. If all items can't fit into the current ClientRect, a vertical
  scrollbar is displayed.

  right mouse button. If RightClickSelect is True, the value of SelectedIndex is the value of the

  value of
  SelectedIndex is the item last clicked using the left mouse button.

@@TJvOwnerDrawViewerOptions.LazyRead
Summary
  Specifies whether items are read into the control as needed or all at once.

  multiple items cannot be selected in the list box at the same time.
  
  MultiSelect allows users to select multiple non-sequential items. It also allows users to select a
  range of items in one operation. To select non-sequential items, hold the Ctrl key while clicking
  on the items. To select a range of items, select the first item, hold the Shift key and select the
  last item.
