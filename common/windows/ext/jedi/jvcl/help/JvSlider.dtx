  at design time is created automatically.
  
  Pass a single Component as a parameter to provide the slider control with an Owner that is
  responsible for freeing it.
  
  \Create calls the inherited \Create method, then sets the initial values for the slider control as
  follows:
  
  * Maximum is set to 100.
  * Position is set to 0.
  * Horizontal is set to true.
  * The default images for the thumb and ruler are loaded.

  Use AutoSize to make the slider adjust its size automatically so the client area accommodates the
  height and width of the ruler image. When AutoSize is false, the slider is fixed in size. When
  AutoSize is true, the size of the slider readjusts whenever the ruler image changes.
  
  By default, AutoSize is true.
