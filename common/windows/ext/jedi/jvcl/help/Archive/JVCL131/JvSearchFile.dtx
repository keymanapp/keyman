<TITLE TJvSearchFile overview>
<GROUP JVCL.Miscel>
  Use TJvSearchFile to search for files.
  
  * Write an OnFound event to take action when a file is found.
  * Set Mask to limit which files are found by the component.
  * Use Recursive to specify if the component should also search in subdirectories.
  * Call Execute with a parameter specifying the directory where the search starts.
  * Use the events OnStart, OnEnded and OnChangedDir to take action during the search, when the search
    starts, ends, or starts in another directory. For example, you could use these events to notify
    the user in which directory the component is searching.

<GROUP TJvSearchFile>
Summary
  Enables you to search for files.
Description
  Use a TJvSearchFile component to search for files whose name matches the pattern specified by 
  property Mask. Call Execute by passing it a directory, to start the search in that directory.
  Set Recursive to True to also search in it's subdirectories.
  
  Note that you must write an OnFound event handler to take specific action when the component finds 
  a matching file; otherwise no search will actually be performed.

  StartPath. 
  
  A search action is actually performed, only if an OnFound event handler is specified.
Parameters
  StartPath - Specifies the directory in which the component first searches for files. Use the 
              property Recursive to search also in the subdirectories of StartPath.

  Set Mask to a regular expression to limit the results to files that match the mask. The value of the
  mask is a filename which can contain wildcard characters (* and ?). The asterisk (*) is a wildcard
  which matches any number of arbitrary characters. The question mark (?) is a wildcard which matches
