</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Preliminary
Documentation<br>
<br>
</span>TJvCsvDataSet is a simple data-aware database table object,
similar to TClientDataSet, or the old BDE component TTable, except that
(a) it works with Delphi Personal Edition, and (b) it has no runtime
requirements. No external DLLs or COM objects are required.<br>
<br>
You can now create a simple database application, and use all of
Delphi's data aware controls, and not have to use ADO, BDE, Interbase,
or any other database at all. In fact, for small data tables, CSV files
are just perfect.<br>
<br>
The field types supported by this object are:<br>
     - Strings, fixed length limits are implied
(for your own good), up to 256 bytes.<br>
     - Integers, Floats, DateTimes<br>
<br>
Note that any field type you may wish to have supported that is not
currently supported could be easily added in the future, except for
BLOBs (BLOBs).  <br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">How To Use It:<br>
<br>
</span>(1)  Drop a TjvCsvDataSet onto a form, and a TDataSource,
and connect them by setting the TDataSource's DataSet property.<br>
(2) Set the properties of the TJvDataSet, notably the FileName property
(you can either type a name of a file that does not exist yet, or you
can click the ellipsis button ('...') in the property editor, to browse
for an existing CSV file that you have.    Next, you
have to set the CsvFieldDef property. The best way is to click the
Elipsis button in the property editor.  Remember to set the
LoadsFromFile property to true if you want the contents of the data set
to be autoloaded into memory for you when you start, and set
SavesChanges to force it to overwrite the file when closing the csv
dataset object.  <br>
<br>
(3) Continue as if you were using a normal TTable, TADOTable, or
TClientDataSet object.<br>
