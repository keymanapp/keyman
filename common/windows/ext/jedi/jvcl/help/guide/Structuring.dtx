<TITLE Structuring>
<TOPICORDER 200>
  Writing help is done using a simple text editor. Because a single topic file consists of all
  symbols in a unit and each symbol (called a topic) consists of various sections, it is wise to
  follow a set of rules to get a consistent look and feel for these files.
  
  Most rules have been determined by trying out many different ways of formatting and structuring.
  The current set of rules seems to give the most satisfying structure. Please note that at the time
  of this writing (September 29th, 2002) not all topic files are entirely consistent with these
  rules. Because we don't have the time to go back and change it, these files remain in their
  current form.
