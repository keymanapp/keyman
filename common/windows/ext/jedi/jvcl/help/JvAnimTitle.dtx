Summary
  Caption animation component.
Description
  TJvAnimTitle is a component to provide an animated form caption. The component handles two things:
  
  * Animate the caption (the caption appears character by character and then disappears).
  * Allow the caption to blink <I>x</I> time after the caption has appeared.
  
  To use this component you should:
  
  * Construct a TJvAnimTitle instance at run-time.
  * Set the Title to the title to display (by default set to the forms Caption. Changes to the forms
  Caption are not mirrored in this property).
  * Set the <LINK TJvAnimTitle.Delay, delay> between two animation steps.
  * Optionally set Blink to the number of blinks after the title is fully displayed or leave it at 0
  if   you don't want the caption to blink.
  * Activate the component by setting property Enabled to true.
