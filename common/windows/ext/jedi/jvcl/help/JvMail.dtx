@@TJvMail.SeedMessageID
Summary
  Species the message identifier seed for a request.
Description
  SeedMessageID is used to identify a specific incoming message. After calling FindFirstMail or

  message found.
  
  When property SeedMessageID is set to a valid message identifier, you can call ReadMail to read the
  message associated with that message identifier. FindNextMail uses the value of SeedMessageID as
  seed for the request.
  Note
  Because message identifiers are messaging system-specific and can be invalidated at any time,
  message identifiers are valid only for the current session.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvMail.SendMail
Summary
  Sends a message.
Description
  Call SendMail to send a standard message, with or without any user interaction. The profile must be
  configured so that SendMail can open the default service providers without requiring user
  interaction. But if loNewSession is included in LogonOptions (thus disallowing the use of a shared
  session) and the profile requires a password, then loLogonUI must be set or the function will fail.
  Avoid this situation by using an explicit profile without a password or by using the default
  profile without a password. Use property SimpleMAPI to retrieve a default profile.
  
  You can provide a full or partial <LINK TJvMail.Recipient, list of recipient names>, <LINK
  TJvMail.Subject, subject text>, <LINK TJvMail.Attachment, file attachments>, or <LINK TJvMail.Body,
  message text>. If any information is missing, SendMail can prompt the user for it. If no
  information is missing, either the message can be sent as is or the user can be prompted to verify
  the information, changing values if necessary.
  
  A successful return from SendMail does not necessarily imply recipient validation. The message
  might not have been sent to all recipients. Depending on the transport provider, recipient
  validation can be a lengthy process.
  
  Applications that send messages to custom recipients (i.e., recipients not listed in the \address
  book) can avoid name resolution by setting the Address property of the recipient TJvMailRecipient
  object to the custom \address.
  
  The following example sets the values of properties of a TJvMail object, and then calls SendMail.
  
  <CODE>
  JvMail1.Clear;
  JvMail1.Recipient.AddRecipient(ToEdit.Text);
  JvMail1.Subject := SubjectEdit.Text;
  JvMail1.Body.Text := BodyEdit.Text;
  JvMail1.Attachment.Assign(AttachmentMemo.Lines);
  JvMail1.SendMail; </CODE>
Parameters
  ShowDialog - Specifies whether to display a dialog box to prompt the user for recipients and other 
               sending options. When ShowDialog is set to false, at least one recipient must be      
        specified.

@@TJvMail.ResolveName
Summary

Description
  Call ResolveName to resolve a message recipient's name (as entered by a user) to an unambiguous \
  ddress list entry, by prompting the user to choose between possible entries. The dialog box is
  read-only, prohibiting changes.
Parameters
  Name - Specifies the name to be resolved.
Return value

@@TJvMail.SaveMail
Summary
  Saves a message into the message store.
Description
  Call SaveMail to save a message, optionally replacing an existing message. Before calling SaveMail,
  use the FindFirstMail and FindNextMail functions to verify that the message to be saved is the one
  you want saved. The elements of the message identified by the MessageID parameter are replaced by
  the elements specified by the properties Recipient, BlindCopy, CarbonCopy, Subject, Body and
  Attachment.
  If MessageID is an empty \string, a new message is created. All replaced messages are saved in
  their appropriate folders. New messages are saved in the folder appropriate for incoming messages
  of that class.
  
  Not all messaging systems support storing messages. If the underlying messaging system does not
  support message storage, an EJclMapiError exception is raised.
  
  Because message identifiers are system-specific and opaque and can be invalidated at any time,
  SaveMail considers a message identifier to be valid only for the current Simple MAPI session.
  SaveMail handles invalid message identifiers by raising an EJclMapiError exception.
Parameters
  MessageID - Specifies either the message identifier to be replaced by the save operation or an
  empty              \string, indicating that a new message is to be created.

Summary
  Retrieves a message for reading.
Description
  Call ReadMail to retrieve one message, copying the message content into the properties and classes
  as used in the SendMail function. ReadMail will fill the following properties:
  
  * Subject, with the message subject.
  * Body, with the message body.
  * Attachment, with the filenames of temporary files where to file attachments are saved.
  * ReadedMail, with the delivery time and the sender.

  Use ReadOptions to customize the message retrieving behavior. For example you can specify that only
  envelope information is to be returned from the call or specify whether the message is marked as
  sent or unsent.
  
  Before calling ReadMail, use the FindFirstMail and FindNextMail functions to verify that the
  message to be read is the one you want to be read. FindFirstMail and FindNextMail fill property
  SeedMessageID with the ID of the last message found, and that property is subsequently used by
  ReadMail to identify the message to be read.
