<GROUP JVCL.Graphics.Static>
<FLAG Component>
Summary
  Supports extended features such as fade in, fade out and image flipping.
Description
  TJvSpecialImage is an image that can be used to create special effects.
  
  For example, you can use the methods FadeIn, and FadeOut to let an image slowly appear and
  disappear on the form. The same effect can be accomplished by using the property Brightness, which
  sets the brightness of the image. Set Stretch to True to reduce flickering.
  
  Use the Flipped and Mirrored to flip the image vertically or horizontally. Use Inverted to invert
  the image.
  
  Call Reset to restore the image to its original state.
