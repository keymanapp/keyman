@@TJvPatchFile.StartFile
Summary
  Original file to be patched with the component.
Description
  StartFile is a TFileName property that specifies the file with the original content to be patched
  using the Patch method. Values in the Differences property are applied to the contents of the file
  specified in StartFile using the Patch method to yield a file with the desired content.
  
  Use ChangeInFile to indicate if changes in the Differences property should be applied directly to
  the content of the original file, or stored in the file specified in EndFile.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvPatchFile.Patch
Summary
  Applies the specified patches to a file.
Description
  Patch is a Boolean function used to apply the patches in the Differences property to the contents
  of the original file specified in StartFile. Patch returns True when the Differences are
  successfully applied to the original file.
  
  Patch reads and decrypts the contents of the Differences property using the value specified in the
  Password parameter. Password is the value used when creating the values in Differences using its'
  design-time property editor. Using a Password argument that is different than the value used to
  populate the Differences property will result in an unusable file after patches are applied.
  
  Use StartFile to specify the file name with the content to be patched using the values in
  Differences.
  
  Use EndFile and ChangeInFile to indicate where the patched contents of the file indicated in
  StartFile should be stored. When ChangeInFile contains False, the value in EndFile is used to
  create a file the patch file content is stored. When ChangeInFile contains False, patches in the
  Differences property overwrite the original contents of the file specified in StartFile.
  
  Assign values to the Differences property, or load the values from a file, to indicate the actions
  to perform in the Patch method. Values in Differences must be in the specific format required by the
  TJvPatchFile component.
  
  A design-time property editor is provided for the Differences property that can be used to create patches in the format required for use i
   the component. Patches for the specified files are encrypted using the Password provided at
  design-time.
Parameters
  Password - Password to use when encrypting patch file contents.
Return value
  Boolean - True when patches in the Differences property are applied to the original file content.

@@TJvPatchFile.IsPatchable
Summary
  Indicates if the specified file appears to be patchable.
Description
  IsPatchable is a Boolean function used to indicate if the file specified in Filename can be patched
  using the values in Differences. IsPatchable performs a rudimentary test to determine if the
  specified file name can be patched; the file in Filename must exist and the file size for the
  unpatched file stored in Differences must match the file size for the file in Filename.
  
  IsPatchable does not perform any in-depth comparison of the contents of the file in Filename.
Parameters
  FileName - File to check.
Return value
  Boolean - True when

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvPatchFile.IsPatched
Summary
  Checks a file to determine if it may have already been patched.
Description
  IsPatched is a Boolean function used to indicate if patches in the Differences property have
  already been applied using the Patch method. IsPatched performs a rudimentary test for the file
  specified in
  Filename; the file must exist and its' size is examine to determine if it matches the size stored
  in the Differences property. It does not perform any in-depth comparison of the contents with the
  file specified in StartFile.
  
  IsPatched returns False when Filename cannot be located, Differences contains an invalid format, or
  when the size of the file in Filename differs from the value for the patched file in Differences.
Parameters
  FileName - File to check for updated content.
Return value
  Boolean - True when the file appears to have been patched.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvPatchFile.EndFile
Summary
  File where patched file content can be stored.
Description
  EndFile is a TFileName property that specifies the file where the patched contents of the file
  specified in StartFile should be stored.
  
  EndFile is used in the Patch method when ChangeInFile contains False. Patches from the Differences
  property are applied to the original file content and stored in EndFile at the completion of the
  patching process.
  
  When ChangeInFile contains True, the patches in Differences are applied directly to the contents of
  the file specified in StartFile and the value EndFile is ignored.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvPatchFile.Differences
Summary
  Patches (or file differences) to apply to the original file.
Description
  Differences is a TStrings property that represents patches (or file differences) required to
  convert the file specified in StartFile to the desired content using the Patch method.
  
  Values stored in Differences must be in the specific format required for the TJvPatchFile component.
  A design-time property editor is provided for the Differences property that can be used to create patches in the format required for use
  in the component. Patches for the specified files are encrypted using a Password provided at
  design-time.
  
  Patches in the Differences property can be saved to a file for subsequent distribution and
  processing using the TJvPatchFile component.
  
  When patches are applied using the Patch method, the updated file content can be overwritten in the
  original file or stored in a new file with the updated content. Applying patches in the Differences
  property requires the Password used when creating the list of file differences. Using a Password
  argument that is different than the value used to populate the Differences property will result in
  an unusable file after patches are applied.
  
  Use StartFile to specify the file name with the content to be patched using the values in
  Differences.
  
  Use EndFile and ChangeInFile to indicate where the patched contents of the file indicated in
  StartFile should be stored. When ChangeInFile contains False, the value in EndFile is used to
  create a file the patch file content is stored. When ChangeInFile contains False, patches in the
  Differences property overwrite the original contents of the file specified in StartFile.
  
  Assign values to the Differences property, or load the values from a file, to indicate the actions
  to perform in the Patch method.

@@TJvPatchFile.Destroy
Summary
  Frees the object instance.
Description
  Destroy is the overridden destructor for the object instance. Destroy frees resources allocated to
  the Differences property, and calls the inherited method.

@@TJvPatchFile.ChangeInFile
Summary
  Indicates patches should be applied directly to the original file.
Description
  ChangeInFile is a Boolean property that indicates patches in the Differences property should be
  applied directly to the original file. ChangeInFile is used in the Patch method when the content in
  the Differences property is read and decrypted.
  
  Use EndFile to specify the file name where the patched contents of StartFile should be stored when
  ChangeInFile contains False.
  
  When ChangeInFile contains True, the patches in Differences are applied directly to the contents of
  the file specified in StartFile.

<FLAG Component>
Summary
  Implements a file patching utility.
Description
  TJvPatchFile is a TJvComponent descendant that implements a file patching utility.
  
  TJvPatchFile can be used to apply patches in the Differences property to the contents of an
  original file in order to yield a file with the desired content. Values in the Differences property
  are in a specific format required by the TJvPatchFile component.
  
  A design-time property editor is provided for the Differences property that can be used to create patches in the format required for use i
   the component. Patches for the specified files are encrypted using the Password provided at
  design-time.
  
  Patches in the Differences property can be saved to a file for subsequent distribution and
  processing using the TJvPatchFile component.
  
  When patches are applied using the Patch method, the updated file content can be overwritten in the
  original file or stored in a new file with the updated content. Applying patches in the Differences
  property requires the Password used when creating the list of file differences.
