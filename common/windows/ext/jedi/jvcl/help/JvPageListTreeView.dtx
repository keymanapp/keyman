@@TJvPageLinks
Summary
  Class used to facilitate linking nodes to pages in a page list.
Description
  This class is only used at design-time and is provided to activate the design-time editor for
  setting up links between tree nodes and the pages in an IPageList implementation. Do not try to use
  this class or its methods as it isn't a "real" class.

Description
  The Items property of the TJvCustomPageListTreeView is a TJvPageIndexNodes object and maintains the
  collection of nodes in the tree view. Nodes can be added, deleted, inserted, and moved within the
  tree view. Access the nodes in the tree view through the Items property of the tree view.

@@TJvCustomSettingsTreeView
Summary
  A tree view that behaves like the tree view in the Options Dialog in VS.net.
Description
  TJvCustomSettingsTreeView is a base class for tree view controls that behave like the tree view in
  the Settings Dialog in Visual Studio: When a node in the tree view is selected, a new page of
  settings is shown on a panel to the right.
  
  Specifically, the following is true:
  
  * The normal ImageIndex/SelectedIndex is ignored for nodes - use PageNodeImages instead. You still   need to assign a TImageList to the Images property * When a node is expanded, it is assigned the expanded image until it is co
  lapsed, regardless   whether it's selected or not * When a parent folder is selected, the first
  non-folder child has its normal image set as the   selected image * By default, AutoExpand and
  ReadOnly is true, ShowButtons and ShowLines are false
  
  Other than that, it should work like a normal TreeView. Note that the tree view was designed with
  AutoExpand = true in mind but should work with AutoExpand = false
  
  To get the VS look, Images should contain:
  
  * Image 0: Closed Folder
  * Image 1: Open Folder
  * Image 2: Right-pointing teal-colored arrow
  
  PageNodeImages should then be set to (the defaults):
  
  * ClosedFolder = 0;
  * ImageIndex = -1; (no image)
  * \OpenFolder = 1;
  * SelectedIndex = 2;

@@TJvCustomPageListTreeView.PageList
Summary
  Specifies the IPageList implementation.
Description
  Use the PageList property to associate an IPageList implementation with the tree view. If a
  PageList is assigned, the active page of the page list will change automatically when the user
  selects a new node in the tree view. The page that is activated is determined by the value of the
  selected nodes
  PageIndex property.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvCustomPageListTreeView.PageDefault
Summary
  Specifies the index of the default page.
Description
  Use DefaultPage to specify the value of the PageIndex property for new nodes. For example, settings
  this property to 0 will set the PageIndex of new nodes to 0, setting it to 1 will set the PageIndex
  to 1, etc.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvCustomPageListTreeView.PageLinks
Summary
  Used at design-time to set up the association between tree nodes and pages in a PageList.
Description
  This property is only used at design-time to set up the association between a node and the page that should be displayed
  y the IPageList implementation when that node is selected. To set up a page link association at
  run-time, type cast the tree node to TJvPageIndexNode and set its PageIndex property.
  
  \Example:
  <CODE>
    TJvPageIndexNode(JvCustomPageListTreeView1.Items[SomeIndex]).PageIndex := SomePageIndex; </CODE>
  
  The linking will only have effect if the PageList property has been assigned.

@@TJvCustomPageListTreeView
Summary
  Base class for tree view controls that has a PageList property of type IPageList.
Description
  Use TJvCustomPageListTreeView as a base class when developing tree view controls that should have
  the ability to be associated with an IPageList implementation.
  
  TJvCustomPageListTreeView has the same functionality as a normal tree view but in addition it can
  also automatically change the active page of an IPageList implementation when the selected node
  changes. Internally, the TJvCustomPageListTreeView component creates its tree nodes as
  TJvPageIndexNodes. A TJvPageIndexNode has a PageIndex property that specifies which page in the
  PageList to active when the node is selected.
  
  Since the nodes in the tree view is surfaced as normal TTreeNodes, you must typecast the TTreeNode
  to
  TJvPageIndexNode in code to access the PageIndex property.
  
  To put a PageList enabled tree view on a form, don't create instances of TJvCustomPageListTreeView.
  Use the TJvPageListTreeView component instead. TJvPageListTreeView only publishes the properties of
  TJvCustomPageListTreeView without adding any new functionality.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvCustomPageListTreeView.Items
Summary
  Lists the individual nodes that appear in the tree view control.
Description
  Individual nodes in this tree view are TJvPageIndexNode objects but they are surfaced as standard
  TTreeNode objects. To access the additional properties and methods of the TJvPageIndexNode class,
  you must type cast the node to a TJvPageIndexNode. The individual nodes can be accessed by using the
  Items property along with the item's index into the tree view. For example, to access the second
  item in the tree view, you could use the following code.
  
  <CODE>
    (Delphi)
      MyTreeNode := TreeView1.Items[1];
    (C++Builder)
      MyTreeNode = TreeView1->Items[1]; </CODE>
  
  When setting this property at design-time in the Object Inspector the Tree View Items Editor
  appears.
  Use the New Item and New SubItem buttons to add items to the tree view. Use the Text property to
  modify what text is displayed in the label of the item.
  
  At run-time nodes can be added and inserted by using the TTreeNodes methods AddChildFirst, AddChild,
  AddChildObjectFirst, AddChildObject, AddFirst, Add, AddObjectFirst, AddObject, and Insert.
  Note
  Accessing tree view items by index can be time-intensive, particularly when the tree view contains
  many items. For optimal performance, try to design your application so that it has as few
  dependencies on the tree views item index as possible.
