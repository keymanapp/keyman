@@TJvPictureItem.ReduceMemoryUsage
Summary
  Minimizes memory usage.
Description
  ReduceMemoryUsage minimizes the memory used by the item by freeing the Picture object but only if
  Filename specifies an existing file (no check is done to determine if Filename is a valid image
  file). When the Picture property of the item is accessed the next time, the image is recreated from
  disk.
  
  You don't have to call ReduceMemoryUsage directly. It is called automatically by the
  TJvImagesViewer when its Options.ReduceMemoryUsage property is true.

@@TJvPictureItem.Picture
Summary
  Provides access to the image the item is displaying.
Description
  Use the Picture property to access the image the item is displaying or to modify the properties of the image. For example, if you want to dis
  lay images that are not on disk, assign an image from another source to the Picture property at
  run-time.

  TJvPictureItem.FileName

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvPictureItem.Caption
Summary
  Specifies the text to display for the item.
Description
  Use Caption to specify the text to display along with the image.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvPictureItem.FileName
Summary
  Specifies the file name of the file on disk the item is displaying.
Description
  Use Filename to set the file on disk the item should be displaying. When changing Filename, the
  item is not updated directly. Instead, Picture is set to nil and the next time the TJvImagesViewer
  control requests the image, it is loaded from disk. This means that an item that is never
  displayed, will not be loaded at all.

@@TJvPictureItem
Summary
  Defines an item in the Items array of a TJvImagesViewer control.
Description
  The TJvImagesViewer displays images either from disk or from other sources. Each item in its Items
  array is of type TJvPictureItem. Use the properties and methods of TJvPictureItem to modify how the
  image is displayed in the TJvImagesViewer control.

@@TJvImageViewerOptions.HotFrameSize
Summary
  Specifies the size of the frame of a hot tracked item.
Description
  Use HotFrameSize to specify the size of the frame when an item is hot tracked. This property only
  has effect when HotTrack is true,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvImageViewerOptions.ImagePadding
Summary
  Specifies the spacing around the image in an item.
Description
  Use ImagePadding to specify the amount of padding that should surround the image in an item. For
  example, if the item is 20 pixels wide and the ImagePadding is 10, only 10 pixels remain to display
  the image.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvImageViewerOptions.HotColor
Summary
  Specifies the color to use when an item is hot tracked.
Description
  Use HotColor to specify the color to use when an item is hot tracked. This property only has effect
  when HotTrack is true. If HotColor is set to clNone, no frame is displayed when the mouse hovers
  over the item, regardless of the HotTrack setting.

  Specifies options and default appearance for the images viewer.
Description
  Use the Options property to customize the appearance and functionality of the images viewer.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvImagesViewer.OnLoadEnd
Summary
  Occurs after the loading of images completed.
Description
  Write a handler for the OnLoadEnd event to take specific action just after the image loading ends.
  Image loading begins when you call LoadImages or change the Directory or FileMask properties and
  ends when all image files matching the file mask in FileMask located in Directory has been loaded.

  TJvImagesViewer.Directory, TJvImagesViewer.FileMask, TJvImagesViewer.LoadImages,
  TJvImagesViewer.OnLoadBegin

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvImagesViewer.OnLoadError
Summary
  Occurs when an error occurs while loading an image.
Description
  Write a handler for the OnLoadError event to take specific actions when an error occurs while
  loading an image from file. For example, if the image file is corrupted or the file does not
  contain a recognized image format, this event is triggered.
Parameters
  Sender   - The object that triggered the event.
  E        - The Exception object that was triggered.
  FileName - The file that triggered the event. This is empty if the image is loaded from some other 
             source than a file on disk (like the clipboard or a TPicture object).
  Handled  - Set this parameter to true if you want to handle the error yourself. If Handled is false
              (the default), no error is reported and the item is removed from the Items property. If
            Handled is set to true, the image is cleared and the exception is raised but the item is
            left in the Items property.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvImagesViewer.OnLoadProgress
Summary
  Occurs periodically during slow operations that affect the image being loaded.
Description
  OnLoadProgress is generated by the particular graphic that the picture object contains. Whether
  OnLoadProgress occurs depends upon the type of graphic the item is loading. Some graphics generate
  this event, others do not. Jpeg images, for example, generate an OnLoadProgress event.
  
  Write an OnLoadProgress event handler to provide the user with feedback during slow operations such
  as loading large compressed images.
  Note
  The PercentDone parameter is only an approximation. With some image formats, the value of
  PercentDone may actually decrease from the value in previous events, as the graphic object
  discovers there is more work to do.
Parameters
  Sender      - The object that triggered the event.
  Item        - The item that is being loaded.
  Stage       - Indicates whether the operation is beginning, continuing, or ending. If the event    
             handler displays an indicator such as a progress bar, the indicator can be created      
         when Stage is psStarting, updated while Stage is psRunning, and removed when Stage is
               psEnding.
  PercentDone - An approximation of how much of the operation has completed. Use PercentDone to
  update                the position of a progress bar or other indicator.
  RedrawNow   - True if the control should be redrawn.
  R           - Indicates whether the image can safely be drawn on screen at this point. The R       
          parameter specifies the portion of the image that has changed and needs to be             
  redrawn.
  Msg         - Contains one or two words that describe what operation is occurring. For example, the
                 value of Msg could be a string such as Loading, Storing, or Reducing colors. The Msg
               string can also be empty.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvImagesViewer.OnLoadBegin
Summary
  Occurs just before the loading of images starts.
Description
  Write a handler for the OnLoadBegin event to take specific action just before the image loading
  begin. Image loading begins when you call LoadImages or change the Directory or FileMask properties
  and ends when all image files matching the file mask in FileMask located in Directory has been
  loaded.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvImagesViewer.FileMask
Summary
  Specifies the file mask to use to filter the files to display.
Description
  Use FileMask to specify the file types to display in the control. FileMask can contain multiple
  file masks and accepts wildcards. Separate individual items with comma or semicolon. Each
  individual mask item is concatenated with the value of Directory and a search is done on that value.
  
  The following examples are all valid file masks: <PRE> *.gif
  *.bmp;*.jpg;*.jpeg
  Jv*.bm?,*.g*,*.ico,*.ani,*.cur </PRE>
  Note
  Changing FileMask triggers the LoadImages method.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvImagesViewer.Directory
Summary
  Specifies the directory to search for files.
Description
  Use the Directory property to specify the directory to search for image files. Directory in
  combination with FileMask defines the file types to find.
  
  If you set Directory to an empty string, it will be expanded to the current directory (as returned
  by
  GetCurrentDir).
  Note
  Changing Directory triggers the LoadImages method.
