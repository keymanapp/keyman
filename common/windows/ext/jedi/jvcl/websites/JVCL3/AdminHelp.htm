    <h2>Administrator Help</h2>
    <hr>
    <p dir="ltr">This document tries to provide the information
      necessary
      for an individual to run the JVCL project. The purpose of this
      document
      is to ease the way for new admins and to remind current admins
      about
      the tasks might they have to perform to make things in JVCL run
      smoothly and also to remind them on how these tasks are most
      easily
      performed. </p>
    <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
    <p dir="ltr">Additionally, this document lists common practices used
      today within the JVCL to complete these tasks.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>All passwords and sensitive URLs are passed from one admin to the
      next via private, secured channels.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>What do admins do?</h4>
    <p>Here's some of the more common tasks an admin might perform:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Keeps the big picture in mind and makes sure the general
        direction of the project is sound.</li>
      <li>Adds and removes developers from the project.</li>
      <li>Has the final say on what to add and what to remove from the
        sources.</li>
      <li>Handles official communications with other parties.</li>
      <li>Makes sure the web site is maintained and up to date.</li>
      <li>Makes sure that new releases are available.</li>
      <li>Jumps in and solves problems noone else is interested in.</li>
      <li>If a member of JEDI Steering, tries to promote and speak for
        the
        project.</li>
      <li>Communicates with the team members in private if needed (or
        wanted), trying to keep the team happy and content.</li>
      <li>Tries to help solve issues between developers within the team
        as
        well as issues with people outside the team.</li>
      <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">Promotes the project whenever and however he can. </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
    <h4 dir="ltr">The web site</h4>
    <p dir="ltr">The web site is currently hosted on a Borland server.
      The
      server location and username/password needed to upload files are
      only
      available to admins. The website files are available in CVS
      (currently
      in dev/website/JVCL3) and should match the content on the home
      page.</p>
    <h4 dir="ltr">&nbsp;</h4>
    <h4 dir="ltr">The project space</h4>
    <p dir="ltr">Sourceforge provides us with space on their servers as
      well. The project can be accessed using SSH Secure Shell (<a
        href="http://www.ssh.com">http://www.ssh.com</a>) using the
      following
      settings:</p>
    <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
    <table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th>Hostname</th>
          <td>shell.sourceforge.net </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Port</th>
          <td>22</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Username</th>
          <td>&lt;your sourceforge username&gt;</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; </p>
    <p dir="ltr">The project web space currently contains the script to
      create the daily zips, a redirect to the new site URL, a copy of
      the
      active CVS (used by the daily zip script), a redirection to the
      current
      location of Mantis and some help related zip files. </p>
    <h4 dir="ltr">&nbsp;</h4>
    <h4 dir="ltr">The daily files</h4>
    <p dir="ltr">The daily zip files at <a
        href="http://jvcl.sf.net/daily">http://jvcl.sf.net/daily</a>
      are generated by a shell script in the sourceforge project web
      space
      (see above). The current script is located in
      /home/groups/j/jv/jvcl/bin and is named postnew.sh. The zip files
      are
      created automatically by a crontab job running once a day. When an
      admin takes over the script maintenance, he also needs to install
      it in
      his own crontab to make sure it runs. For more info on crontab and
      how
      to use it, see the man page in Linux.</p>
    <h4 dir="ltr">&nbsp;</h4>
    <h4 dir="ltr">Managing developers</h4>
    <p dir="ltr">Admins handles adding and removing developers as well
      as
      handling their permissions to various parts of the project. An
      admin
      should make sure that the people having developer status also are
      reasonably active within the project. If it is discovered or
      suspected
      that a developer is doing something dangerous or detrimental to
      the
      JVCL project (like removing files or making strange changes), he
      should
      be removed <i>immediately</i>. A discussion with the developer
      can
      then be initiated and, if a resolution is found, the developer can
      maybe be added again.</p>
    <h4 dir="ltr">&nbsp;</h4>
    <h4 dir="ltr">The GIT repository</h4>
    <p dir="ltr">The GIT repository can be access by anyone having
      developer access. An admins main responsibility in GIT is to add
      and
      remove folder structures when needed and generally keep GIT
      clean.&nbsp; Problems with GIT that cannot be resolved by the
      admin,
      should be reported to GITHub for resolution (stale locks, file
      recasing,
      etc).</p>
    <h4 dir="ltr">&nbsp;</h4>
    <h4 dir="ltr">Preparing releases</h4>
    <p>One of the most important tasks for an admin is making sure the
      releases are created and uploaded. In JVCL3, the release mechanism
      has
      been greatly simplified thanks to the use of want (a commandline
      script
      tool). </p>
    <p>To prepare and create a release, an admin needs to perform the
      following tasks:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Check out a clean copy of JCL and JVCL and test the
        installation
        on all available Delphi/BCB/Kylix versions.</li>
      <li>Check that all examples compiles.</li>
      <li>Once the installation is verified to work, branch the GIT
        repository. The branch should be on the form
        JVCL&lt;ALPHA|BETA|GAMMA|RELEASE|FINAL&gt;&lt;version&gt;.
        Should any
        last minute update come in, add them to the HEAD and the Branch.
        Creating a branch allows developers to continue their work
        without
        impacting on the admin preparation work.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Obtain a fresh copy of the help file from the Help
        Coordinator.</li>
      <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">Run the want script in jvcl/install/release from
          a command
          prompt to create the releases. To see available options, use
          "want
          help" and follow indications in readme.txt.</p>
      </li>
      <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">Once the zip files have been created, upload them
          to
          sourceforge's sftp folder (/ incoming).</p>
      </li>
      <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">Go to the sf project page, log in as an admin and
          create a new release in the release system.</p>
      </li>
      <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">Add the uploaded files to the release as required.</p>
      </li>
      <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">Post update announcements to all mailing lists,
          newsgroups and magazines as listed in
          jvcl/install/release/announce.txt
          (and any others you can come up
          with). </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; </p>
    <h4 dir="ltr">The bug tracker</h4>
    <p>Admins should have admin access to the bug tracker (contact one
      of
      the current Mantis admins if you are a JVCL admin and don't have
      admin
      access to Mantis). As an admin, you should clean up the users list
      from
      time to time and also close old bugs that are either resolved or
      have
      been inactive for a long time. </p>
    <h4 dir="ltr">&nbsp;</h4>
    <h4 dir="ltr">JEDI Steering</h4>
    <p>An admin that is also a member of JEDI Steering, should
      participate
      in the discussions on the JEDI Steering mailing list as much as
      needed.
      JEDI Steering is, despite it's name, not steering the JVCL or any
      other
      JEDI project. Instead, Steering is a forum for JEDI project admins
      to
      discuss and decide on matters that affects all JEDI groups. Active
      JEDI
      projects should have at least one representative in JEDI Steering.</p>
