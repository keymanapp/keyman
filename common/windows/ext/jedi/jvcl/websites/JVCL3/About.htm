<h2>About JVCL</h2>
<p><img border="0" src="images/PoweredByJVCL.gif" alt="Powered by JVCL" width="209" height="31"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The JEDI Visual Component Library (JVCL) consists of a large collection 
(currently ca 500) visual and non-visual components which can be instantly 
reused in your Delphi, Kylix and C++ Builder projects. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The library is built upon code donated from the JEDI community. It is 
reformatted to achieve a common look-and-feel, tested, documented and merged 
into the library. The library is grouped into several categories such as 
Enhanced Standard, Visual, Non-Visual, Data Aware and many, many more. The 
library is released to the public under the terms of the Mozilla Public License 
(MPL) and as such can be freely used in both freeware, shareware, open source 
and commercial projects. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p dir="ltr">Source code files included in the JVCL have a header which 
explicitly states the license (as is required). However, unless noted otherwise, 
all files, including those without an MPL header, are subject to the MPL 
license. </p>
