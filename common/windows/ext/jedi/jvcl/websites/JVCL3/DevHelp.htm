    <h2>Developer Help</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Becoming a developer in JVCL (or any open source project, for
      that
      matter) can be overwhelming at the beginning. Not only are
      you&nbsp;
      unaquainted with the source code but you probably don't have a
      clue as
      to how the work is divided, where to ask for help or what you can
      and
      cannot do.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This document aims to provide you with answers to most of the
      questions you might have about JVCL and what you can do to improve
      it
      and at the same time personally benefit from the work you put in.
      If
      something is
      missing, wrong or unclear don't hesitate to contact us.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>Who will be invited to become a JVCL developer?</h4>
    <p>The only reason to make someone a JVCL developer is to grant them
      write access to GIT. This means that although you might have
      provided a
      lot of help in enhancing the JVCL it is entirely possible that if
      you
      don't need GIT access, you will still not be granted developer
      status.</p>
    <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
    <p dir="ltr">Here's some of the most common criteria we use to
      determine whether someone will be made a developer or not:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Has donated a library of components that has been accepted and
        has agreed on helping maintain it.</li>
      <li>Has provided substantial help with enhancing the JVCL, either
        as
        a bug fixer, donator or in any other way that makes it obvious
        that the
        person needs GIT access</li>
      <li>Knows the JVCL coding style and follows it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Most of the time, developers will be invited by one of the admins
      to
      become a developer but if you feel that you should have GIT
      access, you
      can contact an admin and ask if you can be added to the team. Even
      if
      the admin turns you down, that doesn't have to mean that you have
      done
      anything wrong. Most of the time it is just a matter of
      determining
      whether you actually need GIT access or not.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Note that even if you are not a developer, you can still provide
      bug
      fixes and enhancements through the bug tracker or the newgroups.</p>
    <h4>Who will not become a JVCL developer?</h4>
    <p>People who have contributed nothing or little to the JVCL, who
      doesn't really need GIT access, who has a sloppy coding style, who
      constantly submit buggy and non-working code or have a known
      history of
      malicious behavior towards JVCL or other projects will have little
      chance of becoming a JVCL developer.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>What happens when I become a developer?</h4>
    <p dir="ltr" align="left">First, you are added to the team on the SF
      page by an admin who also sets up your permissions. You should
      then
      have write access to GIT (see the github documentation for
      details).
      The admin also adds you to the various project trackers, so you
      get
      mail when something happens. You will also be added as developer
      to the
      bug tracker which means you can modify and take over bug issues.</p>
    <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
    <h4 dir="ltr">What do I have to do as a developer?</h4>
    <p dir="ltr">Once you are a developer, there is really nothing you <i>have
      </i>to do. JVCL development is based on voluntary work so we don't
      require anyone to do anything but since you have access, doing
      something might be a good idea&lt;g&gt;. You might
      already have a task if you've donated a library and agreed on
      maintaining it.&nbsp; </p>
    <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; </p>
    <p dir="ltr"> The best way to find out what is going on and what
      needs
      to be done is to monitor the newsgroups, the task tracker on the
      SF
      page as well as the bug tracker. </p>
    <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; </p>
    <p dir="ltr">If you're new to JVCL, one of the best ways of getting
      aquainted
      with it is to try to fix some of the bugs reported in Mantis and
      expand
      from there. If you still have nothing to do, posting a message to
      the
      newsgroup letting everyone know that you are available for JVCL
      work,
      will usually trigger at least a couple of replies with
      suggestions.</p>
    <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>What should I avoid doing?</h4>
    <p>There are some things you should avoid in JVCL:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Don't change code without knowing it or without testing it.</li>
      <li>Don't introduce version specific changes (<b>example:</b>
        TStringlist.CaseSensitive is not available in D5 or D6).</li>
      <li>Don't delete files without asking an admin or in the
        newsgroups
        first.</li>
      <li>Don't name units, classes and types in a way that conflicts
        with
        the JVCL standard.</li>
      <li>Don't create new folders or files without prior permission.</li>
      <li>If you have access to several versions of Delphi/C++ Builder,
        test your code with all versions before committing it. </li>
      <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">If you are unsure if a particular code change will
          work with other versions of Delphi, try to find another
          developer
          willing to test it before you commit it.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
    <p dir="ltr">Note that if you've been inactive for some time (at
      least
      several weeks), you might get removed without prior notice. </p>
