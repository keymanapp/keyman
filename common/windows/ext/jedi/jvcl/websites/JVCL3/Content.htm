<p>The JEDI Visual Component Library (JVCL) consists of a large
collection (currently ca 600) visual and non-visual components which
can be instantly reused in your Delphi and C++ Builder projects. </p>
<p>The library is built upon code donated from the JEDI community. It
is reformatted to achieve a common look-and-feel, tested, documented
and merged into the library. The library is grouped into several
categories such as Enhanced Standard, Visual, Non-Visual, Data Aware
and many, many more. The library is released to the public under the
terms of the Mozilla Public License (MPL) and as such can be freely
used in both freeware, shareware, open source and commercial projects. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Source code files included in the JVCL have a header which
explicitly states the license (as is required). However, unless noted
otherwise, all files, including those without an MPL header, are
subject to the MPL license. </p>
