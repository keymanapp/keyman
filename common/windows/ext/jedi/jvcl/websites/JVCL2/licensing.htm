      <br>
      Author perspective</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Q:</b> Do I retain copyright once I publish source under the MPL?<br>
          <b>A:</b> Absolutely. You still retain all your copyrights.<br>
        <li><b>Q:</b> Can I release the code under a different (possibly
          commercial type) license?<br>
          <b>A:</b> Yes. Since you have the original copyright, you can do it,
          but you can do it only for your own code, and not for any
          contributions from others.<br>
        <li><b>Q:</b> In two years Acme, Inc. comes with a great new license,
          which I would love to use. Am I always bound to MPL for my released
          code?<br>
          <b>A:</b> You can use a Dual License approach, i.e. you keep the code
          under MPL, and you add another license, e.g. GPL. The user will have
          then the option to use the one s/he prefers.<br>
          Or, as the Initial Contributor, with the original copyright, you can
          release it under the other license. <i>Please note: even if you
          release the code under new license, users of your original
          MPL-released code can continue to use under MPL as before.</i><br>
        <li><b>Q:</b> I've contributed code to JEDI under MPL, but now I've
          changed my mind and don't want this code to be OpenSource.<br>
          <b>A:</b> Once you release code as OpenSource, you cannot take it back
          as long as the user conforms to the original license. Of course, as
          the Initial developer you can re-release it under different license,
          incl. a commercial one (see above) <br>
        </li>
        <li><b>Q:</b> I think, JEDI could benefit from having cryptographic
          functions. I would like to donate some (DES, Tripple DES etc.), which
          are covered by patent rights (RSA, for example)? How should I do it?<br>
          <b>A:</b> All contributions are &quot;Subject to third party
          intellectual property (IP) claims.&quot; Thus, if you are aware of any
          patents infringements, before submitting make sure that you:
          <ul>
            <li>secure the rights to use the IP in your contribution (e.g. by
              paying a fee)
            <li>modify the code so it doesn't infringe (in our case, provide
              other, non-patented cryptographic functions)
            <li>in a worst case scenario, if the two above are not possible, do
              not submit the code</li>
          </ul>
          <i>Please note: different countries may have different patents laws.
          Therefore in some countries it could be legal to use patented IP (e.g.
          because the patent expired), while in others not. Check with your
          local Patent Office.</i></li>
      </ol>
      <h3>User perspective</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Q:</b> Can I use the MPL code in commercial software? If yes, am
          I obligated to credit the author?<br>
          <b>A:</b> Yes, you can use the MPL code in any commercial software.
          Since you have to include the MPL code, the credit is included in the
          license header. While not required, it is also customary to credit the
          author in &quot;AboutBox&quot;.<br>
        <li><b>Q:</b> Must I release the source code of used components?<br>
          <b>A:</b> Only of those covered by MPL, together with any
          modifications to them.<br>
        <li><b>Q:</b> Must I publish my apps under MPL if I used MPL licensed
          code (the viral aspect) ?<br>
          <b>A:</b> No. That's the big advantage over GPL - you can use
          different code, mix MPL and commercial code, but you don't have to
          release either the application, nor the non-MPL code under MPL.
          Basically, what is MPL, will stay MPL, but it doesn't have any impact
          on the non-MPL code.<br>
        <li><b>Q:</b> If a bug in MPL licensed code renders my clients machine
          unbootable, who can I hold responsible for that?<br>
          <b>A:</b> Nobody. You use MPL licensed code at your own risk. Since it
          is provided to you in a source code form, you can inspect it, test it,
          making sure that it does, what you want it to do.<br>
        <li><b>Q:</b> Must I publish modifications to MPL licensed code?<br>
          <b>A:</b> Yes. This is one of the MPL requirements. You are getting a
          free source code, but you have to publish all modifications to the
          code, unless you have done the changes for your internal use.<br>
        <li><b>Q:</b> Must I publish code based on MPL licensed code under MPL?<br>
          <b>A:</b> Yes. You cannot change the license terms. Only the Initial
          Developer can add an additional license (see dual license)<br>
        <li><b>Q:</b> If I subclass the MPL code, do I still have to publish the
          new code? After all I didn't modify the code at all!<br>
          <b>A:</b> That's a tricky one. By the letter of the law, since you
          didn't touch the original code, you might claim that it is a
          &quot;new&quot; code, therefore no need for MPL. However, by the
          'spirit of the law', Inheritance (or subclassing) is a modification of
          the functionality of a given class, and as such a &quot;derived
          work&quot;, so even if you didn't touch the original code, you are
          still making changes.<br>
        <li><b>Q:</b> I am proposing a modification to a JEDI-VCL component,
          which has a dual license (MPL and GPL). This new file also needs to
          include a new class. Should the source files for the new class be put
          in JEDI-VCL using MPL with GPL dual-license or can it be put in
          another location and use only the MPL?<br>
          <b>A:</b> The license of a file can't be changed without the consent
          of the copyright owner. And a new file derived from an existing file
          inherits the licensing from the existing file. In the case of this
          component, it has to stay MPL/GPL.<br>
        <li>I am considering using an XML parser that has being covered by the
          MPL v1.1 (or alternatively the GPL) in a commercial product. I will
          simply use the DLL libraries without modification, including the
          necessary header files in my own code. When I distribute (sell) my own
          product I would, of course, need to distribute the DLL libraries as
          well. My questions are:
          <ol>
            <li><b>Q1:</b> Am I correct in assuming that simply including
              unmodified header files and linking with a library covered by the
              MPL does not place any legal restrictions or obligations on my
              commercial product and its source code?<br>
              <b>A1:</b> It places no obligations on the code YOU wrote, but
              there are still obligations for the code you included. These
              include source distribution (for included MPL code, not YOUR
              code), and some notification requirements.<br>
            <li><b>Q2:</b> Am I obligated to distribute the (unmodified) source
              code that produced the libraries with which I link?<br>
              <b>A2:</b>  No, you don't have to &quot;physically&quot;
              distribute the source code, but you have to give credit to the
              authors and provide a link to location where the users can
              download the source code (see next question)&nbsp;
              <i><br>
              </i>
            <li><b>Q3:</b> Am I obligated to make my use of the particular
              libraries known to users of my product?<br>
              <b>A3:</b>  Absouletly, it's spelled out in the license. You need to
              credit the source of copyrighted code that is not yours in both
              the product and its documentation.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Q:
We are using JCL v1.32 and JVCL v1.32 in our products. We did not modify the
source codes in any way. Can some one please tell me if we need to add a
Copyright statement in our product's license text and if so, which text is
required?
<p>This is normally done in &quot;AboutBox&quot; and the documentation. To make
it simple, if you use JVCL you can add statement like:</p>
<table border="1" width="80%" cellpadding="8">
  <tr>
    <td>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">
&quot;<b>This program contains JVCL source code that can be obtained from <a href="http://jvcl.sourceforge.net">http://jvcl.sourceforge.net</a></b>&quot;
or
</font>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">
&quot;<b>JVCL portions are licensed from Project JEDI, and the source code can
be obtained from <a href="http://jvcl.sourceforge.net">http://jvcl.sourceforge.net</a></b>&quot;
</font>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>If you look at Microsoft Office programs, you can see bunch of similar legal
statements in their &quot;About Box&quot;.</p>
<p>By including such statement in the AboutBox AND your
documentation, you have fulfilled the requirement to:</p>
<p>a) provide credit to the author&nbsp;<br>
b) provide the user with the location where they can download JVCL source code</li>
      </font>
      </ol>
      <p>&nbsp;
