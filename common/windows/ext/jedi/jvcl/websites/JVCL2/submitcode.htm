<h1><font color="#FF0000">Submitting Code</font></h1>
<p>The JEDI VCL is built upon donations made by the community. If you have
components that you would like to submit to JVCL
then we would love to receive them.
<h3>The rules</h3>
There are few rules that need to be followed. They are primarily to protect
ourselves and to make the inclusion of your code as efficient and smooth as
possible:
<p>&nbsp;
<ul>
  <li>All code that is submitted will be released under the terms of the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/" target="_blank">Mozilla
    Public License</a>. By submitting
    code to Project JEDI you explicitly agree to it. For more information about
    MPL licensing please read our <a href="licensing.htm">Licensing
    page including some FAQ</a>. You can also read the official <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/MPL/FAQ.html">MPL
    FAQ from Mozilla</a>. We suggest that you at least glance through these
    documents before submitting your code. If you still have questions you can
    always <a href="feedback.htm">contact us</a>.
  <li>Submissions must be your own. If code is not your own, you are responsible
    for making sure that the code is not subject to any copyright or license
    that would prevent the JVCL team to modify the code and release the
    resulting code under the terms of the MPL license.
  <li>Code must be packaged in a standard zip compatible file. You should use
    the highest compression available. Inside the package you must include an
    ASCII text-only Readme.txt file which clearly states your name, your e-mail
    address, optionally your homepage address and whether you want to remain
    anonymous or not.
  <li>After submission, the code may be modified. As a rule,
    you will not be contacted for permission to carry out modifications, if you
    are not involved in the maintenance of the code. No
    matter how much your code is modified, at all times the documentation will
    reflect you as being the original author of the code. You will remain the
    copyright holder of your code.
  <li>Submitted code is subject to being reformatted to match the <a href="delphistyleguide.htm">style
    conventions</a> used throughout the JVCL and <a href="guidelines.htm">JVCL
    Guidelines</a>. Contributors will not be forced to convert the components to
    JVCL standard at the time of submission, but might be requested to do so
    after the code has been accepted? (i.e: &quot;Your donation has been
    accepted and will be included in JVCL when you have converted it to JVCL
    standards).&nbsp;
  <li>Donation should include a demo program that creates the component(s)
    dynamically (no need to install in Delphi) and shows off the major
    properties, methods and events.
  <li>After submission, you should hear from us within two weeks about the
    status of your donation.
  <li>The JVCL is a Visual Component Library. To avoid confusion, a class is
    considered a component when it derives from TComponent and it's usage
    requires it to be installed in the IDE and be 'dropped on a form'. These
    kind of a classes will be included in the JVCL. If you have a classes that
    are NOT components that you like to share with the world through Project
    JEDI then please go to <a href="http://delphi-jedi.org/Jedi:CODELIBJCL">Project
    JEDI Code Library (JCL)</a> to contribute it there. A class that does not
    need to be installed in the IDE, even though it may exhibit some kind of
    visual interface at runtime, is not considered a component and is perfectly
    acceptable for the JCL.</li>
