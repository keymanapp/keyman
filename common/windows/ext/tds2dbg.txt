Build notes
-----------

tds2dbg is used for building .dbg files from .tds files so that Delphi
projects can be debugged in WinDbg/Visual Studio and with dump files.

This project builds with Borland C++ 5.5 and not other compilers;
while it may build successfully with other compilers, there appear to 
be alignment issues. Hence, the executable is included in the repository
to avoid requiring another build tool.
