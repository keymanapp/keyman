# Keyman Keyboard Processor API

## Requirements
1. Cross platform.
2. Cross language.
3. Facilitate stateless operation of the Engine.
4. Keyboard format agnostic -- support both KMN and future LDML based keyboards.
5. Support querying Engine attributes.
6. Support querying Keyboard attributes.
7. Idempotent


## Design decisions in support of requirements:
- Use C or C99 types and calling convention for the interface, it has the
  broadest language FFI support. [1,2]
- Have client (Platform layer) code load keyboards, manage & pass state. [3,4,7]
- Provide query calls to return static attributes data for keyboards and
  engine [5,6]
- Provide get/set calls for client accessible keyboard state information [3,4]


## Glossary
- __Platform layer:__
The code that consumes the Keyman Keyboard Processor API, and provides the
operating system-specific handling of keystroke events and integration with
applications.
- __Client Application:__
The application that has the focus and receives text events from the Platform
layer.
- __Context:__ Text preceding the insertion point
- __Marker:__ Positional state that can be placed in the Context.
- __Keyboard:__ A set of rules for execution my an Engine
- __Option:__ A variable in a dynamic or static key value store.
- __Processor:__
The component that implements this API and can parse and execute a particular
keyboard.
- __State:__ An object that hold internal state of the Processor for a given
insertion point
- __Action:__
A directive output by the processor detailing how the Platform layer should
transform the Client Application's text buffer. There may be several items
produced by a single keyboard event.
- __Keyboard Event:__
A virtual key event and modifier map received from the platform to be
processed with the state object for this Client application.
- __Virtual Key:__
A code based on the US English layout, with values matching the Windows
virtual key codes. See keyboardprocessor_vkeys.h for definitions.
- __Modifier Key:__
The set of Control, Shift, Alt, Caps Lock keys. On some platforms these may
have other names (e.g. Alt is called Option on macOS); other platform-specific
modifiers such as Windows key are excluded from this set. Some modifiers are
transient, such as Control, and others have long-lasting state, such as
Caps Lock.

## API
### Namespace
All calls, types and enums are prefixed with the namespace identifier `km_kbp_`

### API idioms
Almost all calls marshalling variable length aggregate data in or out of an API
object take the form:
> km_kbp_status *fn_name*(object_ref, buffer_ptr, size_ptr)

where the buffer is nullable and all other arguments are required (will result
in an `KM_KBP_STATUS_INVALID_ARGUMENT` status being returned if nulled). When
`buffer` is `nullptr` or `0` the function will place the size of the required
buffer in the variable pointed to by `size_ptr`.

Calls which result in the allocation of resources, regardless of resulting
ownership, are of the form:
> km_kbp_status *fn_name*(object_ref, out_ptr)

where `out_ptr` is a valid pointer to a caller allocated variable to hold the
resulting ouput. This is often a reference to a created object. All arguments
are required (will result in an `KM_KBP_STATUS_INVALID_ARGUMENT` status being
returned if nulled).

For accessors to fixed size attributes of an object these will take the form:
> attr_value __fn_name__(object_ref)

`object_ref` is required to be valid and will result in a nonsense value being
returned if `nullptr` or `0`.

All dispose calls are designed to accept null as a valid value and will do
nothing in that event.

### Error Handling
Error handling and success failure notification are communicated through a
general mechanism similar to COM’s `HRESULT` scheme (unlike COM, any non-zero
value is an error). Any functions that can fail will always return a status
value and all results are returned via outparams passed to the function.
```c
*/
enum km_kbp_status_codes {
  KM_KBP_STATUS_OK = 0,
  KM_KBP_STATUS_NO_MEM = 1,
  KM_KBP_STATUS_IO_ERROR = 2,
  KM_KBP_STATUS_INVALID_ARGUMENT = 3,
  KM_KBP_STATUS_KEY_ERROR = 4,
  KM_KBP_STATUS_INSUFFICENT_BUFFER = 5,
  KM_KBP_STATUS_INVALID_UTF = 6,
  KM_KBP_STATUS_INVALID_KEYBOARD = 7,
  KM_KBP_STATUS_OS_ERROR = 0x80000000
};

/*
```
The final status code KM_KBP_STATUS_OS_ERROR is intended to allow encapsulating
a platform error code; the remaining 31 low bits are the error code returned by
the OS for cases where the failure mode is platform specific. For HRESULT codes
this only permits failure codes to be passed.


### Context
The context is the text prior to the insertion point (caret, cursor).
The context is constructed by the Platform layer, typically by interrogating the
Client Application.  The context will be updated by the engine for keystroke
events.  If the Platform layer code caches the context, the context should be
reset when a context state change is detected. Context state changes can occur
when the user uses the mouse to move the insertion point, uses cursor keys,
switches applications or input fields, or presses hotkeys such as Ctrl+N to
start a new document. The full set of context state change triggers is up to the
Platform layer.

Context can also contain positional Markers (also known as 'deadkeys' in kmn
keyboards), which are transitory state flags that are erased whenever a context
state change is detected. Markers are always controlled by the Engine.

Contexts are always owned by their state.  They may be set to a list of
context_items or interrogated for their current list of context items.

### Options
A state’s default options are set from the keyboard at creation time and the
environment. The Platform layer is then is expected to apply any persisted
options it is maintaining.  Options are passed into and out of API functions as
simple C arrays of `km_kbp_option_item` terminated with a `KM_KBP_OPTIONS_END`
sentinel value. A state's options are exposed and manipulatable via the
`km_kbp_options` API. All option values are of type C string.

During processing when the Platform layer finds a PERSIST action type it should
store the updated option in the appropriate place, based on its scope.
For RESET the processor will apply the pristine value from the original scope,
the Platform layer should update that only if it manages a previously persisted
value.

### `km_kbp_state_dispose`
##### Description:
Free the allocated resources belonging to a `km_kbp_state` object previously
returned by `km_kbp_state_create` or `km_kbp_state_clone`. After this all
pointers previously returned by any km_kbp_state family of calls will become
invalid.

### `km_kbp_state_context`
##### Description:
Get access to the state object's context.
##### Return:
A pointer to an opaque state object. This pointer is valid for the lifetime
of the state object. If null is passed in, then null is returned.
##### Parameters:

### `km_kbp_state_action_items`
##### Description:
Get the list of action items generated by the last call to
`km_kbp_process_event`.
##### Return:
A pointer to a `km_kbp_action_item` list, of `*num_items` in length. This data
becomes invalid when the state object is destroyed, or after a call to
`km_kbp_process_event`. Do not modify the contents of this data. The returned
array is terminated with a `KM_KBP_IT_END` entry.
##### Parameters:
- __state__: A pointer to the opaque `km_kbp_state` object to be queried.
- __num_items__:
A pointer to a result variable: The number of items in the action item list
including the `KM_KBP_IT_END` terminator. May be null if not that
information is required.

/*
```
### `km_kpb_state_to_json`
##### Description:
Export the internal state of a `km_kbp_state` object to a JSON format document
and place it in the supplied buffer, reporting how much space was used. If null
is passed as the buffer the number of bytes required is returned. If there is
insufficent space to hold the document, the contents of the buffer is undefined.
The encoding of the returned data is UTF-8.

__WARNING__: The structure and format of the JSON document while independently
versioned is not part of this API and is intended solely for use in diagnostics
or by development and debugging tools which are aware of processor
implementation details.
##### Return status:
- `KM_KBP_STATUS_OK`: On success.
- `KM_KBP_STATUS_NO_MEM`: In the event an internal memory allocation fails.
##### Parameters:
- __state__: An pointer to an opaque state object.
- __buf__: A pointer to the buffer to place the C string containing the JSON
document into. May be null.
- __space__: A pointer to a size_t variable. This variable must contain the
number of bytes available in the buffer pointed to by `buf`, unless `buf` is
null. On return it will hold how many bytes were used.

### `km_kbp_process_event`
##### Description:
Run the keyboard on an opaque state object with the provided virtual key and modifer

state is passed.

##### Parameters:
