 * Models the path over time through coordinate space taken by a touchpoint during

 *
 *  _Supported events_:
 *
 * `'step'`: a new Event has been observed for this touchpoint, extending the path.
 * - Parameters:
 *   - `sample: InputSample` - the coordinate & timestamp of the new observation.
 *
 * `'complete'`: the touchpoint is no longer active; a touch-end has been observed.
 *   - Provides no parameters.
 *   - Will be the last event raised by its instance, after any final 'segmentation'
 *     events.
 *   - Still precedes resolution Promise fulfillment on the `Segment` provided by
 *     the most recently-preceding 'segmentation' event.
 *     - And possibly recognition Promise fulfillment.
 *
 * `'invalidated'`: the touchpoint is no longer active; the path has crossed
 * gesture-recognition boundaries and is no longer considered valid.
 *   - Provides no parameters.
 *   - Will precede the final 'segmentation' event for the 'end' segment
 *   - Will precede resolution Promise fulfillment on the `Segment` provided by
 *     the most recently-preceding 'segmentation' event.
 *     - And possibly recognition Promise fulfillment.
