 * that instantly queue against this class's `queueWithPriority` method, they are considered
 * "synchronous" - as they're all placed on the queue before the queue regains control and before
 * the first of the three Promises signals its resolution.
 *
 * If each of the three then awaits its turn via said queueing, they will each then resolve in order

   *   "instant resolution" is queued (1) after the third call queues itself AND (2) after any
   *   of the others that queue with a higher priority level have received their turns.
