/**
 * This class fulfills two roles:
 *
 * 1.  The `.isCompatible()` function provides the core definition used by
 * `ConstructingSegment` to re-merge compatible subsegments, 'correcting' any
 * 'oversegmentation' that may have resulted from `PathSegmenter`'s algorithm.
 *
 * 2. This class's other properties and methods facilitate inspection of
 * the algorithm and its decision-making process during interactive debugging
 * sessions.
 *
 * `SegmentationSplit` objects are constructed from Subsegmentation objects,
 * which are made in abundance throughout the segmentation algorithms.  So, it
 * shouldn't be difficult to construct the necessary parameters to dynamically
 * construct instances of this class during an interactive debugging session.
