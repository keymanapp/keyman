// Mostly used here to compare the sum-squared error components of segmented regressions
// to the sum-squared "modeled" components of their overall variance.  Those are the two
// "independent random variables" we're examining.  Variances (which are sums of squared
// values themselves) tend to be chi-squared distributed, fulfilling the conditions.
// That's stats-speak for "what this module does with it has a solid theoretical basis."
//
// We do NOT want to be computing this thing at run-time.  (Just take one look at the
// equations found in that Wikipedia article!)  Fortunately, it's very common in stats
// circles to just... use a lookup table for finding p-values for things following
// the f-distribution.
//
// For future non-stats-inclined maintainers:
// One could say that the p-value = the chance that what we have just "randomly" happened
// to occur without our expectations actually being met.  It's a super-common
// stats term; they'd then say that if the p-value is sufficiently low, then we\
// "reject the null hypothesis" - the theory that it actually DID happen randomly - in
// favor of the high likelihood that we really are onto something.

 * This is only a partial implementation; only a couple of numerator degrees-of-freedom are
 * worth our consideration, and there's only marginal gain to be found supporting more
 * denominator degrees-of-freedom than are already supported here.  Keeping it small also
