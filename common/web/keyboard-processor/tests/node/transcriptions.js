the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that
he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force
is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful...
the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course,
he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his
apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death,
