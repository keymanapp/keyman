 * Encapsulates all the state required for the LMLayer's worker thread.
 * 
 * Implements the state pattern. There are three states:
 * 
 *  - `unconfigured`  (initial state before configuration)
 *  - `modelless`     (state without model loaded)
 *  - `ready`         (state with model loaded, accepts prediction requests)
 * 
 * Transitions are initiated by valid messages. Invalid
 * messages are errors, and do not lead to transitions.

 *   config |             |----------->|         |

 *                                          +--------+
