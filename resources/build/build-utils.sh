# This script sets build environment variables. VERSION vars are also exported:
#   VERSION:          Full current build version, e.g. "14.0.1"
#   VERSION_WIN:      Full current build version for Windows, e.g. "14.0.1.0"
#   VERSION_RELEASE:  Current release version, e.g. "14.0"
#   VERSION_MAJOR:    Major version, e.g. "14"
#   VERSION_MINOR:    Minor version, e.g. "0"
#   VERSION_PATCH:    Patch version, e.g. "1"
#   TIER:             Current tier, one of "alpha", "beta" or "stable"
#   VERSION_TAG:      Tier + Pull Request + Location of build [-alpha|-beta][-test[-1234]][-local]
#   VERSION_WITH_TAG: e.g. "14.0.1-alpha-test-1234" or "14.0.5-beta-local" or "14.0.1-alpha-test"
#   KEYMAN_ROOT:      fully resolved root path of Keyman repository
#   VERSION_ENVIRONMENT: One of: local, test, alpha, beta, stable
#   UPLOAD_SENTRY:    true - if VERSION_ENVIRONMENT is one of alpha, beta, stable
#                     false - if local, test.  Indicates if debug artifacts should be uploaded to Sentry
#
# On macOS, this script requires coreutils (`brew install coreutils`)
#
# Here is how to include this script reliably, cross-platform:
#    ## START STANDARD BUILD SCRIPT INCLUDE
#    # adjust relative paths as necessary
#    THIS_SCRIPT="$(greadlink -f "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" 2>/dev/null || readlink -f "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")"
#    . "$(dirname "$THIS_SCRIPT")/../resources/build/build-utils.sh"
#    # END STANDARD BUILD SCRIPT INCLUDE
#
# Note: keep changes to version, tier and tag determination in sync with mkver (windows/src/buildutils/mkver)
