ChangeLog
---------
(This should list both major and minor changes, most recent first.)
8 September 2014  (Diethelm Kanjahn) Mondulkiri Font Family version 7.100
- Mondulkiri changes:
  * The hinting has been improved, the difference between regular and bold 
    is visible on screen in much smaller font sizes than before. 
  * A few bugs were addressed: the disappearing of glyphs on Mac in certain 
    strings that do not occur in correctly typed text, a positioning problem 
    in some Tampuan words on Mac, one syllable in Bunong text on Windows/Linux. 
  * Minor changes in diacritic placement, mostly on Mac. Coeng Kho and coeng 
    Ttha were modified. 
  * Glyphs were added - mostly in the phonetic symbols section. The shaping 
    tables for Mac were streamlined and are now the same as for the Busra font.
- Busra changes:
  * The fonts now have AAT tables so that they work on Mac OS X 
  * many glyphs were added, the glyph range is the same as in Mondulkiri 7.100
  * many glyph shapes and diacritic placements were improved slightly
  * the ligatures of some consonants with the ‘sra-a’, ‘sra-oo’ and ‘sra-ou’ 
    have changed and are now the same as in Mondulkiri.
  * hinting has been improved
  * most other changes from Mondulkiri 5.300 to 5.513 are now also in Busra 7.100
  * The descender value was changed which may affect line spacing.

31 October 2012  (Diethelm Kanjahn) Mondulkiri Font Family version 5.300
- Split Khmer Mondulkiri fonts from older fonts release
- Support for Apple's AAT rendering system (tested in OS X 10.6.8) as well as
   Microsoft OpenType tables.
- Support for typographical features to be used under OS X with software that
   does support them (like Pages or TextEdit, but apparently not MS Word or
   LibreOffice). 
- Support for 'Stylistic Sets' that provide similar options in OpenType as the
   ‘typographical features’ in OS X. These Stylistic Sets work in Adobe software
   (tested with CS5 and 5.5 on PC), but not in MS Word. MS Word 2010 does support
   Stylistic Sets, but apparently only for Latin scripts. 
- Support for Khmer Unicode in Adobe CS5 and CS5.5. Two of the Stylistic Sets
   address the remaining problems. Please refer to the documentation on stylistic
   sets.
- Many Latin script characters have been added. The bold fonts now have also
   bold Latin characters.
- Some of the vowel-a ligatures have been changed (e.g. Cho-AA).
- Many characters have been slightly modified. Most significantly the ‘hooks’ or
   ‘hair’ of some coengs have been removed(e.g. coeng-Kho, coeng-Ha, coeng-Qa).
- The positioning of many characters was modified.
- Many other smaller modifications of glyphs and rules.
- To prevent register shifters from being rendered as subscript
   zero-width-non-joiner has now to be inserted before the register shifter in
   accordance with The Unicode Standard. Also zero-width-joiner has to be in this
   position now to force the alternative rendering.
- Increased the descender by a small amount so that second level elements are no
   longer cut off.
- For users of the Tampuan language: coeng-vo after coeng-ro and shifting of
   samyuk before reahmuk are now enabled by default. The Tampuan option now only
   covers the width of space and the permission to use samyuk after reahmuk.
- The support for the use of vowels and coengs with independent vowels in OS X
   is limited. If there is a real need for improvement please contact the font
   designer.
- Changed position of quotes (U+2018-9, 201C-D) and mirrored U+201C.
