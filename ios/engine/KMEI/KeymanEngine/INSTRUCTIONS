===================================
Creating the Library
===================================

1) select the "Keyman-iphonesimulator" target, and build for simulator
2) select the "Keyman-iphoneos" target, and build for device
3) select the "Keyman-lib" target, and build for device
	- this merges the previous 2 into a universal lib
4) you can now find the lib and headers (there should be 9 .h files) in the xcode build directory
	- e.g. /Users/<username>/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Keyman-xxxxxxxxxx/Build/Products/Release-iphoneos
	- the header files are in this same place under usr/local/include



===================================
Distribution
===================================

1) Create a folder called "libKeyman"
2) Copy in 3 items:
	- libKeyman.a
	- Keyman.bundle
	- the include directory containing the 9 header files created above

This is all a developer needs to use the SDK



===================================
Demo Application
===================================

The demo application is a separate Xcode project which uses the above SDK.

Whenever a new SDK is compiled, it should be copied into the demo project (over-writing the old one).

The demo project settings should not need to be changed in any way during this process.
