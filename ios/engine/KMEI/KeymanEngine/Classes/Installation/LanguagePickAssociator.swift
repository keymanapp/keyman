 * This class is designed for use with the `PackageInstallViewController` or
 * other language-picking UI classes.  As languages are selected in a picker, instances of
 * this class will use the provided `AssociationSearcher` to look up associated
 * resources that are compatible.  These searches will be run concurrently in order to
 * reduce waiting time for end users.
 *
 * When the picker signals that language selection is complete, any detected associations
 * will be returned through the instance's provided `AssociationReceiver`.
 * It is then up to the `AssociationReceiver` to download and install these associations.
 *
 * A default `AssociationSearcher` for lexical model lookups is provided as
 * `static let lexicalModelSearcher`.
