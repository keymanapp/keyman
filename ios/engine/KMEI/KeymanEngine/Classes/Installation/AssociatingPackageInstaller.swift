 * Given a `KeymanPackage` that KeymanEngine knows how to install, this class facilitates language selection as part of the
 * package installation process.
 *
 * "Associations" may also be specified to look up 'associated' resources for the selected language codes and have them install alongside
 * the base package.  For example, installing the `sil_euro_latin` keyboard for `en` (English) with the `.lexicalModels` association
 * will query for `en` models and install them as well as the `sil_euro_latin` package.
 *
 * At the time of writing, this will return the `nrc.en.mtnt` model and will install it for use with `en`
 * before indicating that overall package installation is complete.
