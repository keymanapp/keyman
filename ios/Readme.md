To build Keyman for iOS, please run the build.sh build script within this folder.
You will need to either run with the command-line argument -no-codesign or obtain the necessary security permissions and 
certificate data as part of our core development team to complete the build for the final app.

To run the app within a simulator after build.sh is completed, "Run" the Keyman scheme/target within Xcode.
