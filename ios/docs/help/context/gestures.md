## Using Gestures on the Keyboard Keys
There are now several gestures available to interact with some keys on the keyboard. Keys which have gestures available will normally show them as a hint in the top right of the key:

* **Long press**: Press and hold a key, and after a moment a submenu will appear. Slide the finger to the submenu to select a key. Release the finger, and the highlighted key from the submenu will be output.

* **Flick**: Press and hold a key, and then slide the finger in various directions on a key to reach alternate outputs. The key will animate to show the expected output when the finger gets released. A common flick is to slide down to reach numerals on the top row of the keyboard.

  An up-flick on keys that support longpresses but do not have a defined up-flick will skip the wait and immediately display their longpress submenu.
* **Multitap**: Some keys can be pressed repeatedly and rapidly to reach alternate outputs. Tapping rapidly twice on <kbd>Shift</kbd> will activate <kbd>Caps Lock</kbd> on many keyboards.
