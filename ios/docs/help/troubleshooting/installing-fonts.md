title: Installing fonts - Keyman for iPhone and iPad Help
---

Some keyboards require special fonts that do not come standard with your iPhone or iPad. 
For keyboards that use these fonts, the Keyman app will provide a download of the font to install onto your device, 
meaning all apps will be able to correctly display the font. To install the font, touch **Install**.

You will then be taken to your device settings, and asked to install a profile for the font. Touch **Install**.

Then <span class="command">Install</span> again in the Consent page.
