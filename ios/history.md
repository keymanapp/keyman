### Known Issues

* We have received some reports of a bug with fonts in version 1.2: for some users, their language font fails to display after upgrading to version 1.2 from an earlier version. This is happening due to a change in the cached data for your language. To fix the problem on your iPhone or iPad: 
	* Open the Keyboards list by touching the globe button on the keyboard. 
	* Swipe left on the keyboard with the issue to delete it. 
	* Click the Add (+) button to reinstall the keyboard. You should not need to reinstall the font profile.
