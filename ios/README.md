# Keyman for iOS

## Prerequisites
* Xcode 9.1
* iOS 8+
* SwiftLint (`brew install swiftlint`)
* Carthage (`brew install carthage`)

## Keyman App

The source for our published iOS Keyman app is found within the **keyman/** subdirectory. This project only contains
the views specific to the Keyman app, while the core functionality is found in KeymanEngine.framework.

### Building
To build Keyman for iOS, please run the build.sh build script within this folder.
You will need to run with the command-line argument `-no-codesign` or establish alternate code-signing permissions to
complete the build for the final app.

To run the app within a simulator after build.sh is completed,
1. Open **keymanios.xcworkspace** in Xcode.
2. Run the Keyman target.

The Keyman app relies on KeymanEngine.framework, which will automatically be rebuilt by Xcode whenever it is changed.

### Running the app on a physical device
In order to test any code changes on a physical device, Apple requires that an app be code-signed.  (Note that code-signing is not necessary for Simulator runs.)  The quickest way to handle this for personal testing:

- Open Xcode and the settings for the Keyman target.
- Establish personal code-signing permissions.
  - Go to the **General** tab and enable "Automatically manage signing" and select your "Personal Team."
  - Change the "Bundle Identifier" for both the Keyman and SWKeyboard targets to something personal and unique.
  - Afterward, swap to the **Capabilities** tab, remove the existing "App Groups", and define your own unique group for the Keyman target.
  - Then, make the "App Group" settings of SWKeyboard match those of Keyman.
  - Perform a find and replace for the group identifier "group.KM4I" and with your selected unique group name.
  - Correct any further error messages Xcode presents you with.
  - **Note**:  All changes for this step (code-signing permissions, app groups, bundle identifier, etc) must be reverted to the original settings for submitted PRs.
- Under the **Product > Destination** Xcode menu, select the device you wish to use for testing.
- Attempt to "Run" Keyman on the device.  The operation should fail, but this step is necessary to continue.
- Now, on the device itself, go to **Settings > General > Profiles & Device Management** and give your developer account trusted permissions.

You should then be freely able to test the app on your personal development device.

## KeymanEngine

KeymanEngine is a Swift 4 framework containing the core functionality of Keyman, including
* The keyboard view and text views that use the Keyman keyboard.
* Keyboard selection and downloading.

### Building
To build using command line, run `./build.sh -only-framework`.

To build in Xcode,
1. Open **engine/KMEI/KeymanEngine.xcodeproj**.
2. Build the KME-universal target.

The framework will be built to **engine/KMEI/build/(Debug|Release)-universal/KeymanEngine.framework**.

### Linking with KeymanEngine
1. Add KeymanEngine.framework to 'Linked Frameworks and Libraries' and 'Embedded Binaries' in your project targets.

### Usage
`TextView` and `TextField` can be used in place of `UITextView` and `UITextField`. These views use Keyman as a keyboard
and will render with custom fonts. `KeyboardPickerButton` and `KeyboardPickerBarButtonItem` open a view for the user to
switch keyboards or download new keyboards. `InputViewController` can be subclassed to create a system keyboard.

`Manager` must be set up when your app is initializing. If your app has a system keyboard, you must create an app group
entitlement, and set `Manager.applicationGroupIdentifier` before any KeymanEngine classes are initialized and before
`Manager.shared` is used. Also set `Manager.shared.openURL` to `UIApplication.shared.openURL` in your app. Refer to
`Manager` for more detailed usage and configuration options.

### Samples
The KeymanEngine project contains a demo app that demonstrates usage of the framework. There are also two sample apps in
**sample/**. KMSample1 demonstrates use of `TextView` and bundling a keyboard in your app. KMSample2 demonstrates how to
create a system keyboard.

To build the samples, `cd` into the project directory and run `./build.sh`.
