# Keyman Keyboard Processor API

## Requirements
1. Cross platform.
2. Cross language.
3. Facilitate stateless operation of the Engine.
4. Keyboard format agnostic -- support both KMN and future LDML based keyboards.
5. Support querying Engine attributes.
6. Support querying Keyboard attributes.
7. Idempotent


## Design decisions in support of requirements:
- Use C or C99 types and calling convention for the interface, it has the
  broadest language FFI support. [1,2]
- Have client (Platform layer) code load keyboards, manage & pass state. [3,4,7]
- Provide query calls to return static attributes data for keyboards and
  engine [5,6]
- Provide get/set calls for client accessible keyboard state information [3,4]


## Glossary
- __Platform layer:__
The code that consumes the Keyman Keyboard Processor API, and provides the
operating system-specific handling of keystroke events and integration with
applications.
- __Client Application:__
The application that has the focus and receives text events from the Platform
layer.
- __Context:__ Text preceding the insertion point
- __Marker:__ Positional state that can be placed in the Context.
- __Keyboard:__ A set of rules for execution by an Engine
- __Option:__ A variable in a dynamic or static key value store.
- __Processor:__
The component that implements this API and can parse and execute a particular
keyboard.
- __State:__ An object that holds internal state of the Processor for a given
insertion point
- __Action:__
A directive output by the processor detailing how the Platform layer should
transform the Client Application's text buffer. There may be several items
produced by a single keyboard event.
- __Keyboard Event:__
A virtual key event and modifier map received from the Platform layer to be
processed with the state object for this Client application.
- __Virtual Key:__
A code based on the US English layout, with values matching the Windows
virtual key codes. See `keyman_core_api_vkeys.h` for definitions.
- __Modifier Key:__
The set of Control, Shift, Alt, Caps Lock keys. On some platforms these may
have other names (e.g. Alt is called Option on macOS); other platform-specific
modifiers such as Windows key are excluded from this set. Some modifiers are
transient, such as Control, and others have long-lasting state, such as
Caps Lock.

## API
### Namespace
All calls, types and enums are prefixed with the namespace identifier `km_core_`

### API idioms
Almost all calls marshalling variable length aggregate data in or out of an API
object take the form:
> km_core_status *fn_name*(object_ref, buffer_ptr, size_ptr)

where the buffer is nullable and all other arguments are required (will result
in an `KM_CORE_STATUS_INVALID_ARGUMENT` status being returned if nulled). When
`buffer` is `nullptr` or `0` the function will place the size of the required
buffer in the variable pointed to by `size_ptr`.

Calls which result in the allocation of resources, regardless of resulting
ownership, are of the form:
> km_core_status *fn_name*(object_ref, out_ptr)

where `out_ptr` is a valid pointer to a caller allocated variable to hold the
resulting ouput. This is often a reference to a created object. All arguments
are required (will result in an `KM_CORE_STATUS_INVALID_ARGUMENT` status being
returned if nulled).

For accessors to fixed size attributes of an object these will take the form:
> attr_value __fn_name__(object_ref)

`object_ref` is required to be valid and will result in a nonsense value being
returned if `nullptr` or `0`.

All dispose calls are designed to accept null as a valid value and will do
nothing in that event.

### Error Handling
Error handling and success failure notification are communicated through a
general mechanism similar to COM’s `HRESULT` scheme (unlike COM, any non-zero
value is an error). Any functions that can fail will always return a status
value and all results are returned via outparams passed to the function.
```c
*/
enum km_core_status_codes {
  KM_CORE_STATUS_OK = 0,
  KM_CORE_STATUS_NO_MEM = 1,
  KM_CORE_STATUS_IO_ERROR = 2,
  KM_CORE_STATUS_INVALID_ARGUMENT = 3,
  KM_CORE_STATUS_KEY_ERROR = 4,
  KM_CORE_STATUS_INSUFFICENT_BUFFER = 5,
  KM_CORE_STATUS_INVALID_UTF = 6,
  KM_CORE_STATUS_INVALID_KEYBOARD = 7,
  KM_CORE_STATUS_OS_ERROR = 0x80000000
};

/*
```
The final status code KM_CORE_STATUS_OS_ERROR is intended to allow encapsulating
a platform error code; the remaining 31 low bits are the error code returned by
the OS for cases where the failure mode is platform specific. For HRESULT codes
this only permits failure codes to be passed.


### Context
The context is the text prior to the insertion point (caret, cursor).
The context is constructed by the Platform layer, typically by interrogating the
Client Application.  The context will be updated by the engine for keystroke
events.  If the Platform layer code caches the context, the context should be
reset when a context state change is detected. Context state changes can occur
when the user uses the mouse to move the insertion point, uses cursor keys,
switches applications or input fields, or presses hotkeys such as Ctrl+N to
start a new document. The full set of context state change triggers is up to the
Platform layer.

Context can also contain positional Markers (also known as 'deadkeys' in kmn
keyboards), which are transitory state flags that are erased whenever a context
state change is detected. Markers are always controlled by the Engine.

Contexts are always owned by their state.  They may be set to a list of
context_items or interrogated for their current list of context items.

action must be performed before the `output` action, but the other
actions may be performed in any order.

### `km_core_actions_dispose`

returned by `km_core_state_get_actions`.
##### Parameters:

```c
*/
KMN_API
km_core_status

### `km_core_context_status`

  KM_CORE_CONTEXT_STATUS_ERROR = 3,      // Internal error
  KM_CORE_CONTEXT_STATUS_INVALID_ARGUMENT = 4, // Invalid arguments
} km_core_context_status;

/*
```
### `km_core_state_context_set_if_needed`
##### Description:
Sets the internal cached context for the state object, to the passed-in
application context string, if it differs from the codepoints in the
cached context. For the purposes of comparison, (1) cached markers are
ignored, (2) if the cached context is shorter than the application
context, it is considered identical, but (3) if the cached context is
longer, then it is considered different.

If a difference is found, then the cached context will be set to the
application context, and thus any cached markers will be cleared.

`km_core_state_context_set_if_needed` and `km_core_state_context_clear`
will replace most uses of the existing Core context APIs.

##### Parameters:
- __state__: An opaque pointer to a state object.
- __application_context__: A pointer to an null-terminated `km_core_cp`
    string representing the current context from the application.
##### Return status:
- `KM_CORE_CONTEXT_STATUS_UNCHANGED`: Cached context change was not needed
- `KM_CORE_CONTEXT_STATUS_UPDATED`: Cached context was set to application
  context
- `KM_CORE_CONTEXT_STATUS_CLEARED`: Application context was invalid, perhaps
  had unpaired surrogates, and so cached context was cleared instead
- `KM_CORE_CONTEXT_STATUS_ERROR`: Internal error
- `KM_CORE_CONTEXT_STATUS_INVALID_ARGUMENT`: One or more parameters was null

### `km_core_state_context_clear`
##### Description:
Clears the internal cached context for the state. This is the same as
`km_core_context_clear(km_core_state_context(&state))`.

`km_core_state_context_set_if_needed` and `km_core_state_context_clear`
will replace most uses of the existing Core context APIs.

##### Parameters:
- __state__: An opaque pointer to a state object.
##### Return status:
- `KM_CORE_STATUS_OK`: On success.
- `KM_CORE_STATUS_INVALID_ARGUMENT`: If any parameters are null.

### Options
A state’s default options are set from the keyboard at creation time and the
environment. The Platform layer is then is expected to apply any persisted
options it is maintaining.  Options are passed into and out of API functions as
simple C arrays of `km_core_option_item` terminated with a `KM_CORE_OPTIONS_END`
sentinel value. A state's options are exposed and manipulatable via the
`km_core_options` API. All option values are of type C string.

During processing when the Platform layer finds a PERSIST action type it should
store the updated option in the appropriate place, based on its scope.
For RESET the processor will apply the pristine value from the original scope,
the Platform layer should update that only if it manages a previously persisted
value.
