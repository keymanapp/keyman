c maximum store length is 4096 UTF-16 code units, including U+0000 terminator
c #define GLOBAL_BUFSIZE  4096   // compfile.h
c so we need 0x101D - 0x0020 + 1 = 0x0FFE --> 4094 words
c + 1, for 'a' in the rule below = 4095, which triggers the buffer boundary check.
c Noting that this is conservative and losing 1 possible char, but not fixing
c in compiler.cpp at this time.

store(x)    U+0020 .. U+101D

'a' outs(x) + 'x' > 'x' context
