# Keyman Developer - kmc-analyze

This package provides Keyman keyboard analysis tools. It can be used from the
command line with [@keymanapp/kmc](https://npmjs.com/package/@keymanapp/kmc).

Currently, the primary function of this package is to work with Keyman's
[`&displayMap` store](https://help.keyman.com/developer/language/reference/displaymap) for
rewriting the On Screen Keyboard with PUA characters, for consistent display of
diacritics and combining marks across all platforms.
