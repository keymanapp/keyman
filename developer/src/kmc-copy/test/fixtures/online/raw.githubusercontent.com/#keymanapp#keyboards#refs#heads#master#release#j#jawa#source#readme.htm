<h1>Javanese Script keyboard - Nulisa Aksara Jawa</h1>
                             
<p>This keyboard is designed to type all Javanese characters and stacks directly. You get a Javanese character every time you press a Latin key, without having to use the Alt key or memorizing arbitrary key locations in QWERTY keyboard. This keyboard is based on Benny Lin's Nulisa Aksara Jawa web transliterator program - http://is.gd/nulisa.</p>

<p>The main feature of this keyboard:
<ol>
<li>Almost qwerty-like layout. You won't see the Aksara Jawa on the default layer, <u>on purpose</u>. You can get the aksara Jawa typed by tapping the Latin keys.<br />
No, they're not "Jawa palsu" or "fake Javanese script"  that uses ASCII, these are true Javanese script Unicode.<br />
The difference is you type the aksara naturally as if you type Javanese language in Latin.
</li><li>To remind you that this is a Javanese script keyboard, I put several Aksara Jawa characters, such as 'pangkon' instead of 'q', and 'adeg-adeg' to the right of 'L', and 'pada lungsi' and 'pada lingsa'.
</li><li>Since Q is unused, I substituted it with 'pangkon'. Since X is unused, I substituted it with 'e pepet' (schwa). These are probably the only 2 special characters you need to memorize.
</li><li>Support all Javanese script characters and all kinds of rules, (such as 'nc'/'nj' nasalized/'sengau' sound). 
</li><li>Lastly, you can expect the same keyboard to behave the same way in all devices and platform, be it PC/Linux, Web, or Mobile (App and Web). Nulisa Aksara Jawa for Keyman is the ultimate solution for typing Javanese script on your devices.
