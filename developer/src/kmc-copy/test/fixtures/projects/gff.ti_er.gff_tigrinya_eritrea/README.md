GFF Tigrinya-Eritrean Lexical Model
===================================

© 2023 Geʾez Frontier Foundation

Version 1.0.1

Description
-----------

This is a Tigrinya (ትግርኛ , ISO-639-2 ti-ER) lexical model developed to support predictive text in 
the corresponding GFF Tigrinya-Eritrea keyboard.  The lexical model is based on the content found from 131
issues of the Haddas Eritrea (ሓዳስ ኤርትራ) newspaper. English words have been removed from the generated word list,
but quality checks for spelling, etc. have not been performed.  These checks are left as a goal for a
future version of the lexical model.
