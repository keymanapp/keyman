In the case of metadata included within a font, it is legally sufficient to include only a link to the text of the OFL on https://scripts.sil.org/OFL, but we strongly recommend against this. Most modern font formats include metadata fields that will accept the full OFL text, and full inclusion increases the likelihood that users will understand and properly apply the license.\n+The only situation in which an OFL font can be distributed without the text of the OFL (either in a separate file or in font metadata), is when a font is embedded in a document or bundled within a program.

How does that differ from other means of distribution?\n By 'embedding' we mean inclusion of the font in a document or file in a way that makes extraction (and redistribution) difficult or clearly discouraged. In many cases the names of embedded fonts might also not be obvious to those reading the document, the font data format might be altered, and only a subset of the font - only the glyphs required for the text - might be included.

Is this a risk to author(s)?\n The few utilities that can extract fonts embedded in a PDF will typically output limited amounts of outlines - not a complete font. To create a working font from this method is much more difficult and time consuming than finding the source of the original OFL font. So there is little chance that an OFL font would be extracted and redistributed inappropriately through this method. Even so, copyright laws address any misrepresentation of authorship. All Font Software released under the OFL and marked as such by the author(s) is intended to remain under this license regardless of the distribution method, and cannot be redistributed under any other license.

At a minimum you must include the copyright statement, the license notice and the license text. A mention of this information in your About box or Changelog, with a link to where the font package is from, is good practice, and the extra space needed to carry these items is very small. You do not, however, need to include the full contents of the font package - only the fonts you use and the copyright and license that apply to them. For example, if you only use the regular weight in your app, you do not need to include the italic and bold versions.\n \n-1.21 What about including OFL fonts by default in my firmware or dedicated operating system? \n+1.21  What about including OFL fonts by default in my firmware or dedicated operating system? \n Many such systems are restricted and turned into appliances so that users cannot study or modify them. Using open fonts to increase quality and language coverage is a great idea, but you need to be aware that if there is a way for users to extract fonts you cannot legally prevent them from doing that. The fonts themselves, including any changes you make to them, must be distributed under the OFL even if your firmware has a more restrictive license. If you do transform the fonts and change their formats when you include them in your firmware you must respect any names reserved by the font authors via the RFN mechanism and pick your own font name. Alternatively if you directly add a font under the OFL to the font folder of your firmware without modifying or optimizing it you are simply bundling the font like with any other software collection, and do not need to make any further changes.\n \n-1.22  Can I make and publish CMS themes or templates that use OFL fonts?  Can I include the fonts themselves in the themes or templates? Can I sell the whole package?\n-Yes, you are very welcome to integrate open fonts into themes and templates for your preferred CMS and make them more widely available. Remember that you can only sell the fonts and your CMS add-on as part of a software bundle.

(See entry 1.4 for details and examples about selling bundles).\n \n 1.23  Can OFL fonts be included in services that deliver fonts to the desktop from remote repositories? Even if they contain both OFL and non-OFL fonts?\n Yes. Some foundries have set up services to deliver fonts to subscribers directly to desktops from their online repositories; similarly, plugins are available to preview and use fonts directly in your design tool or publishing suite. These services may mix open and restricted fonts in the same channel, however they should make a clear distinction between them to users. These services should also not hinder users (such as through DRM or obfuscation mechanisms) from extracting and using the OFL fonts in other environments, or continuing to use OFL fonts after subscription terms have ended, as those uses are specifically allowed by the OFL.\n \n 1.24  Can services that provide or distribute OFL fonts restrict my use of them?\n No. The terms of use of such services cannot replace or restrict the terms of the OFL, as that would be the same as distributing the fonts under a different license, which is not allowed. You are still entitled to use, modify and redistribute them as the original authors have intended outside of the sole control of that particular distribution channel. Note, however, that the fonts provided by these services may differ from the Original Versions.\n \n+1.25  Can a font released under the OFL be used as a source by an AI (Artificial Intelligence), an ML (Machine Learning) model, a NN (neural network), or similar system to create a new font and release it under a different license?\n+No. Any font produced from such systems whose input or training data contains any source file from a font project licensed under the OFL should be considered a derivative work. All Font Software released under the OFL and marked as such by the author(s) must remain under the OFL regardless of the way the sources might have been transformed, in whole or in part. If you would like to use font sources to produce a font to be released under a different license, then you need to contact the corresponding authors directly to ask for their explicit permission.\n \n-2  USING OFL FONTS FOR WEBPAGES AND ONLINE WEB FONT SERVICES\n+1.26  Can OFL fonts be used by AI-based design tools?\n+Yes, as long as the resulting work is not intended to be a font. Using such automated systems to produce graphical output - something that is not a font - is considered similar to normal usage. It is equivalent to using an OFL font in the graphic design process as discussed in question 1.1.\n \n-NOTE: This section often refers to a separate paper on 'Web Fonts & RFNs'. This is available at https://scripts.sil.org/OFL_web_fonts_and_RFNs\n \n-2.1  Can I make webpages using these fonts?\n-Yes! Go ahead! Using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is recommended. Your three best options are: \n-- referring directly in your stylesheet to open fonts which may be available on the user's system\n-- providing links to download the full package of the font - either from your own website or from elsewhere - so users can install it themselves\n-- using @font-face to distribute the font directly to browsers. This is recommended and explicitly allowed by the licensing model because it is distribution. The font file itself is distributed with other components of the webpage. It is not embedded in the webpage but referenced through a web address which will cause the browser to retrieve and use the corresponding font to render the webpage (see 1.11 and 1.15 for details related to embedding fonts into documents). As you take advantage of the @font-face cross-platform standard, be aware that web fonts are often tuned for a web environment and not intended for installation and use outside a browser. The reasons in favour of using web fonts are to allow design of dynamic text elements instead of static graphics, to make it easier for content to be localized and translated, indexed and searched, and all this with cross-platform open standards without depending on restricted extensions or plugins. You should check the CSS cascade (the order in which fonts are being called or delivered to your users) when testing.\n+2  USING OFL FONTS FOR WEBPAGES AND ONLINE WEBFONT SERVICES\n \n-2.2  Can I make and use WOFF (Web Open Font Format) versions of OFL fonts?\n-Yes, but you need to be careful. A change in font format normally is considered modification, and Reserved Font Names (RFNs) cannot be used. Because of the design of the WOFF format, however, it is possible to create a WOFF version that is not considered modification, and so would not require a name change. You are allowed to create, use and distribute a WOFF version of an OFL font without changing the font name, but only if:\n+NOTE: This section often refers to a separate paper on 'Webfonts and Reserved Font Names'.

Go ahead! You could ask visitors to download and install the fonts, but loading the fonts dynamically as webfonts through CSS @font-face declarations is a much better method. The referenced fonts can be hosted on the same server as other site assets and content, or loaded from a separate webfont service.

You must come up with a unique name - we recommend one corresponding to your domain or your particular web application. Be aware that only the original author(s) can use RFNs. This is to prevent collisions between a derivative tuned to your audience and the original upstream version and so to reduce confusion.\n+2.2.1  How can I make sure that a WOFF/WOFF2 version is not considered modification?\n+You are allowed to create, use and distribute a WOFF version of an OFL font without changing the font name, but only if the original font data remains unchanged except for WOFF compression, and WOFF-specific metadata is either omitted altogether or present and includes, unaltered, the contents of all equivalent metadata in the original font.\n \n-Please note that most WOFF conversion tools and online services do not meet the two requirements listed above, and so their output must be considered a Modified Version. So be very careful and check to be sure that the tool or service you're using is compressing unchanged data and completely and accurately reflecting the original font metadata.\n+2.2.2  Do WOFF conversion tools and services automatically meet these requirements?\n+No. Some WOFF conversion tools and online services do not meet the two requirements listed above, and so their output must be considered a Modified Version.

The origin and open status of the font should be clear among the other fonts you are hosting. Authorship, copyright notices and license information must be sufficiently visible to your users or subscribers so they know where the font comes from and the rights granted by the author(s). Make sure the font file contains the needed copyright notice(s) and licensing information in its metadata. Please double-check the accuracy of every field to prevent contradictory information. Other font formats, including EOT/EOTLite/CWT and superior alternatives like WOFF, already provide fields for this information. Remember that if you modify the font within your library or convert it to another format for any reason the OFL restrictions apply and you need to change the names accordingly. Please respect the author's wishes as expressed in the OFL and do not misrepresent original designers and their work. Don't lump quality open fonts together with dubious freeware or public domain fonts. Consider how you can best work with the original designers and foundries, support their efforts and generate goodwill that will benefit your service.

Also you need to bear in mind the other important parameters beyond compression, speed and responsiveness: you need to consider the audience of your particular website or web application, as choosing some optimization parameters may turn out to be less than ideal for them. Subsetting by removing certain glyphs or features may seriously limit functionality of the font in various languages that your users expect. It may also introduce degradation of quality in the rendering or specific bugs on the various target platforms compared to the original font from upstream. In other words, remember that one person's optimized font may be another person's missing feature. Various advanced typographic features (OpenType, Graphite or AAT) are also available through CSS and may provide the desired effects without the need to modify the font.\n \n-2.6  Is subsetting a web font considered modification?\n-Yes. Removing any parts of the font when delivering a web font to a browser, including unused glyphs and smart font code, is considered modification. This is permitted by the OFL but would not normally allow the use of RFNs. Some newer subsetting technologies may be able to subset in a way that allows users to effectively have access to the complete font, including smart font behaviour.

If a character can be properly displayed using the Original Version, then that same character, encoded correctly on a webpage, will display properly.\n - Provides the same smart font behavior. Any dynamic shaping behavior that works with the Original Version should work when optimized, unless the browser or environment does not support it. There does not need to be guaranteed support in the client, but there should be no forced degradation of smart font or shaping behavior, such as the removal or obfuscation of OpenType, Graphite or AAT tables.\n - Presents text with no obvious degradation in visual quality. The lettershapes should be equally (or more) readable, within limits of the rendering platform.\n - Preserves original author, project and license metadata. At a minimum, this should include: Copyright and authorship; The license as stated in the Original Version, whether that is the full text of the OFL or a link to the web version; Any RFN declarations; Information already present in the font or documentation that points back to the Original Version, such as a link to the project or the author's website.\n \n If an optimized font meets these requirements, and so is considered to be FE, then it's very likely that the original author would feel that the optimized font is a good and reasonable equivalent. If it falls short of any of these requirements, the optimized font does not reasonably represent the Original Version, and so should be considered to be a Modified Version. Like other Modified Versions, it would not be allowed to use any RFNs and you simply need to pick your own font name.\n \n-2.9  Isn't use of web fonts another form of embedding?\n-No. Unlike embedded fonts in a PDF, web fonts are not an integrated part of the document itself. They are not specific to a single document and are often applied to thousands of documents around the world. The font data is not stored alongside the document data and often originates from a different location. The ease by which the web fonts used by a document may be identified and downloaded for desktop use demonstrates that they are philosophically and technically separate from the web pages that specify them. See https://scripts.sil.org/OFL_web_fonts_and_RFNs\n+2.9  Can fonts released under the OFL be used with Incremental Font Transfer (IFT) or similar on-the-fly subsetting and compression technologies?\n+Yes, if they provide a sufficient level of Functional Equivalence. Extra care should be taken to make sure that such processes - both on the server and on the client - do not break glyph coverage and smart features especially for lesser-known and lesser-resourced languages in the resulting document or app. See the 'Webfonts and Reserved Font Names' paper on https://openfontlicense.org/webfonts-and-reserved-font-names for more about the goals and the rationale.\n \n-2.10  So would it be better to not use RFNs at all if you want your font to be distributed by a web fonts service?\n-No. Although the OFL does not require authors to use RFNs, the RFN mechanism is an important part of the OFL model and completely compatible with web font services. If that web font service modifies the fonts, then the best solution is to sign a separate agreement for the use of any RFNs. It is perfectly valid for an author to not declare any RFNs, but before they do so they need to fully understand the benefits they are giving up, and the overall negative effect of allowing many different versions bearing the same name to be widely distributed. As a result, we don't generally recommend it.\n+2.10  Isn't use of webfonts another form of embedding?\n+No. Unlike embedded fonts in a PDF, webfonts are not an integrated part of the document itself.

For example if an OFL font called \"Foo\" contains a notice that \"Foo is a trademark of Acme\", then if you rename the font to \"Bar\" when creating a Modified Version, the new trademark notice could say \"Foo is a trademark of Acme Inc. - Bar is a trademark of Roadrunner Technologies Ltd.\". Trademarks work alongside the OFL and are not subject to the terms of the licensing agreement. The OFL does not grant any rights under trademark law. Bear in mind that trademark law varies from country to country and that there are no international trademark conventions as there are for copyright. You may need to significantly invest in registering and defending a trademark for it to remain valid in the countries you are interested in. This may be costly for an individual independent designer.\n \n-3.8 If I commit changes to a font (or publish a branch in a DVCS) as part of a public open source software project, do I have to change the internal font names? \n+3.8  If I commit changes to a font (or publish a branch in a DVCS) as part of a public open source software project, do I have to change the internal font names? \n Only if there are declared RFNs. Making a public commit or publishing a public branch is effectively redistributing your modifications, so any change to the font will require that you do not use the RFNs. Even if there are no RFNs, it may be useful to change the name or add a suffix indicating that a particular version of the font is still in development and not released yet. This will clearly indicate to users and fellow designers that this particular font is not ready for release yet.

But as an original author of that specific font you can always re-release it separately under another license of your own choosing. Of course, you cannot re-license a font for which you are not the author. If there are multiple authors they need to be all in official written agreement with the re-licensing. For practical reasons, a different name than an existing and publicly available open font should be chosen.\n+\n+4.7  Should I apply the OFL early in the design process, even before the font is complete, or wait until I want to release a completed version?\n+It is really up to you and the circumstances of your project. But in any case, we would recommend you place appropriate warning messages in your public repository or website to say something like \"Please wait for a finished release before using and redistributing this font\". We recommend you have a clear versioning scheme and repository tagging to make it as easy as possible to see if the font is a released version or still under development. You can also consider choosing a separate name (or suffix) for the development version, and only give the final name to a released version.\n+\n \n 5  CHOOSING RESERVED FONT NAMES\n \n@@ -237,7 +249,7 @@ These are font names, or portions of font names, that the author has chosen to r\n The best way to acknowledge the source of the design is to thank the original authors and any other contributors in the files that are distributed with your revised font (although no acknowledgement is required). The FONTLOG is a natural place to do this. Reserved Font Names ensure that the only fonts that have the original names are the unmodified Original Versions. This allows designers to maintain artistic integrity while allowing collaboration to happen. It eliminates potential confusion and name conflicts. When choosing a name, be creative and avoid names that reuse almost all the same letters in the same order or sound like the original. It will help everyone if Original Versions and Modified Versions can easily be distinguished from one another and from other derivatives. Any substitution and matching mechanism is outside the scope of the license.\n \n 5.3  What do you mean by \"primary name as presented to the user\"? Are you referring to the font menu name?\n-Yes, this applies to the font menu name and other mechanisms that specify a font in a document. It would be fine, however, to keep a text reference to the original fonts in the description field, in your modified source file or in documentation provided alongside your derivative as long as no one could be confused that your modified source is the original. But you cannot use the Reserved Font Names in any way to identify the font to the user (unless the Copyright Holder(s) allow(s) it through a separate agreement). Users who install derivatives (Modified Versions) on their systems should not see any of the original Reserved Font Names in their font menus, for example.

We do not recommend using parts of words because of potential confusion, but it is allowed. For example, if \"Foobar\" was a Reserved Font Name, you would be allowed to use \"Foo\" or \"bar\", although we would not recommend it.

For example, the author of a font called \"Foobar Sans\" would declare \"Foobar\" as a Reserved Font Name, but not \"Sans\", as that is a common typographical term, and may be a useful word to use in a derivative font name. Reserved Font Names should also be single words for simplicity and legibility. A font called \"Flowing River\" should have Reserved Font Names \"Flowing\" and \"River\", not \"Flowing River\". You also need to be very careful about reserving font names which are already linked to trademarks (whether registered or not) which you do not own.\n \n 5.6  Do I, as an author, have to identify any Reserved Font Names?\n-No. RFNs are optional and not required, but we encourage you to use them. This is primarily to avoid confusion between your work and Modified Versions. As an author you can release a font under the OFL and not declare any Reserved Font Names. There may be situations where you find that using no RFNs and letting your font be changed and modified - including any kind of modification - without having to change the original name is desirable. However you need to be fully aware of the consequences. There will be no direct way for end-users and other designers to distinguish your Original Version from many Modified Versions that may be created.

For example, even if \"Foobar\" is a RFN, you could write up an agreement to give company \"XYZ\" the right to distribute a modified version with a name that includes \"Foobar\". This allows for freedom without confusion. The existence of such an agreement should be made as clear as possible to downstream users and designers in the distribution package and the relevant documentation.

Do I have to change the name of the font when my packaging workflow includes a full rebuild from source?\n Yes, all rebuilds which change the font data and the smart code are Modified Versions and the requirements of the OFL apply: you need to respect what the Author(s) have chosen in terms of Reserved Font Names. However if a package (or installer) is simply a wrapper or a compressed structure around the final font - leaving them intact on the inside - then no name change is required. Please get in touch with the author(s) and copyright holder(s) to inquire about the presence of font sources beyond the final font file(s) and the recommended build path. That build path may very well be non-trivial and hard to reproduce accurately by the maintainer. If a full font build path is made available by the upstream author(s) please be aware that any regressions and changes you may introduce when doing a rebuild for packaging purposes is your own responsibility as a package maintainer since you are effectively creating a separate branch.

This open stack includes input methods, smart fonts, smart rendering libraries and smart applications.

To take advantage of the advanced typographic capabilities of this font, you must be using applications that provide an adequate level of support for Graphite or OpenType. These advanced capabilities provide access to the variant character forms used in some languages.</p>\n-    <h4 id=\"do-you-supply-a-keyboard-to-use-with-abyssinica-sil\"><em>Do you supply a keyboard to use with Abyssinica SIL?</em></h4>\n-    <p>No keyboards are supplied with the font. However, there are suggested keyboards listed in <a href=\"resources.html\">Resources</a>.</p>\n-    <h4 id=\"my-language-uses-variant-forms-of-some-ethiopic-characters.-how-do-i-type-these-using-the-abyssinica-sil-font-how-do-i-use-features\"><em>My language uses variant forms of some Ethiopic characters. How do I type these using the Abyssinica SIL font? How do I use features?</em></h4>\n-    <p>You should type the character the same way you would type the standard form of the character. Then, you need to select the variants to be displayed. If your application supports Graphite or the OpenType Character Variant features, you can use these to access the font features built into the font. See <a href=\"features.html\">Font Features</a> page for more details.</p>\n-    <p>If your application does not support Graphite features or the OpenType Character Variants, you can use TypeTunerWeb to customize the font with the variants you require. See <a href=\"features.html\">Font Features</a> page for more details.</p>\n-    <h4 id=\"why-did-you-remove-the-stylistic-sets-from-ver.-2.000-of-the-abyssinica-sil-font\"><em>Why did you remove the Stylistic Sets from ver. 2.000 of the Abyssinica SIL font?</em></h4>\n-    <p>Originally we added the Stylistic Sets because there was not a good solution for accessing the glyph variants in the font. At one point we also tried encoding them in the Private Use Area (PUA). PUA characters have now almost all been unencoded since the characters are now either encoded in Unicode or the variants are available through <strong>Character Variants</strong>. The Stylistic Sets were implemented inconsistently, and because of that we chose to remove them rather than attempt to fix them. If you still wish to use a font with Stylistic Sets, ver. 1.500 is still available on the <a href=\"previous-versions.html\">Previous Versions</a> page.</p>\n-    <h4 id=\"i-have-a-copy-of-the-sil-abyssinica-font.-can-you-tell-me-how-this-differs-from-abyssinica-sil\"><em>I have a copy of the <strong>SIL Abyssinica</strong> font. Can you tell me how this differs from <strong>Abyssinica SIL</strong>?</em></h4>\n-    <p>It is best to upgrade to <strong>Abyssinica SIL</strong>. <strong>SIL Abyssinica</strong> (and <strong>SIL Abyssinica U</strong> and <strong>SIL Abyssinica G</strong>) was an early, unreleased version of <strong>Abyssinica SIL</strong>. Although a Unicode font, it only supported Unicode 3.0 and thus had a number of PUA characters in it which have since been added to Unicode 4.1 and 6.0. You should convert your data to Unicode 6.0 and use <strong>Abyssinica SIL</strong>. A mapping file to convert your data from PUA to Unicode 6.0 is available here: <a href=\"https://github.com/silnrsi/wsresources/tree/master/scripts/Ethi/mappings/sil-pua-unicode\">sil-pua-unicode</a>. If you do not convert your data to official Unicode codepoints you will never be able to use another Ethiopic font because those are <strong>Private</strong> codepoints and other fonts do not support them.</p>\n-    <h4 id=\"you-have-characters-which-are-encoded-in-the-pua-area.-is-there-any-likelihood-that-these-will-ever-be-in-unicode-if-so-will-you-update-abyssinica-sil\"><em>You have characters which are encoded in the PUA area. Is there any likelihood that these will ever be in Unicode? If so, will you update Abyssinica SIL?</em></h4>\n-    <p>Version 1.500 incorporated all characters that are in Unicode 6.0.</p>\n-    <p>With version 2.000 we removed almost all of the PUA characters in the font because they are either available through their official Unicode codepoints or through the Character Variants.</p>\n-    <h4 id=\"i-would-like-to-bundle-abyssinica-sil-with-my-application---can-i\"><em>I would like to bundle Abyssinica SIL with my application - can I?</em></h4>\n-    <p>The <a href=\"https://scripts.sil.org/OFL\">SIL Open Font License</a> allows bundling with applications, even commercial ones, with some restrictions.</p>\n+    <p>Here are a few of the most frequently asked questions\n+    specifically regarding Abyssinica SIL:</p>\n+    <h4 id=\"what-is-so-special-about-abyssinica-sil\"><em>What is so\n+    special about Abyssinica SIL?</em></h4>\n+    <p>This font is designed to work with the OpenType font technology.\n+    To take advantage of the advanced typographic capabilities of this\n+    font, you must be using applications that provide an adequate level\n+    of support for OpenType.

The OpenType features completely support everything that\n+    Graphite supported. Removing Graphite reduces the size of the font\n+    and some of the complexities of building the font.</p>\n+    <h4 id=\"do-you-supply-a-keyboard-to-use-with-abyssinica-sil\"><em>Do\n+    you supply a keyboard to use with Abyssinica SIL?</em></h4>\n+    <p>No keyboards are supplied with the font.

Here are a\n Here are a few of the most frequently asked questions specifically regarding Abyssinica SIL:\n \n #### *What is so special about Abyssinica SIL?*\n-This font is designed to work with two advanced font technologies, Graphite and OpenType. To take advantage of the advanced typographic capabilities of this font, you must be using applications that provide an adequate level of support for Graphite or OpenType. These advanced capabilities provide access to the variant character forms used in some languages.\n+This font is designed to work with the OpenType font technology. To take advantage of the advanced typographic capabilities of this font, you must be using applications that provide an adequate level of support for OpenType. The advanced OpenType capabilities provide access to the variant character forms used in some languages.\n+\n+#### *Why did you remove Graphite from Abyssinica SIL?*\n+Until version 2.300 this font included the Graphite advanced font technology. The OpenType features completely support everything that Graphite supported. Removing Graphite reduces the size of the font and some of the complexities of building the font. \n \n #### *Do you supply a keyboard to use with Abyssinica SIL?*\n \n No keyboards are supplied with the font. However, there are suggested keyboards listed in [Resources](resources.md).\n \n #### *My language uses variant forms of some Ethiopic characters. How do I type these using the Abyssinica SIL font? How do I use features?*\n \n-You should type the character the same way you would type the standard form of the character. Then, you need to select the variants to be displayed. If your application supports Graphite or the OpenType Character Variant features, you can use these to access the font features built into the font. See [Font Features](features.md) page for more details.\n+You should type the character the same way you would type the standard form of the character. Then, you need to select the variants to be displayed. If your application supports the OpenType Character Variant features, you can use these to access the font features built into the font. See [Font Features](features.md) page for more details.\n \n-If your application does not support Graphite features or the OpenType Character Variants, you can use TypeTunerWeb to customize the font with the variants you require.

See [Font Features](features.md) page for more details. \n \n #### *Why did you remove the Stylistic Sets from ver. 2.000 of the Abyssinica SIL font?*\n \n Originally we added the Stylistic Sets because there was not a good solution for accessing the glyph variants in the font. At one point we also tried encoding them in the Private Use Area (PUA). PUA characters have now almost all been unencoded since the characters are now either encoded in Unicode or the variants are available through **Character Variants**. The Stylistic Sets were implemented inconsistently, and because of that we chose to remove them rather than attempt to fix them. If you still wish to use a font with Stylistic Sets, ver. 1.500 is still available on the [Previous Versions](previous-versions.md) page.\n \n #### *I have a copy of the **SIL Abyssinica** font. Can you tell me how this differs from **Abyssinica SIL**?*\n \n-It is best to upgrade to **Abyssinica SIL**. **SIL Abyssinica** (and **SIL Abyssinica U** and **SIL Abyssinica G**) was an early, unreleased version of **Abyssinica SIL**. Although a Unicode font, it only supported Unicode 3.0 and thus had a number of PUA characters in it which have since been added to Unicode 4.1 and 6.0. You should convert your data to Unicode 6.0 and use **Abyssinica SIL**. A mapping file to convert your data from PUA to Unicode 6.0 is available here: [sil-pua-unicode](https://github.com/silnrsi/wsresources/tree/master/scripts/Ethi/mappings/sil-pua-unicode). If you do not convert your data to official Unicode codepoints you will never be able to use another Ethiopic font because those are **Private** codepoints and other fonts do not support them.\n+It is best to upgrade to **Abyssinica SIL**. **SIL Abyssinica**, **SIL Abyssinica U**, and **SIL Abyssinica G** were early, unreleased versions of **Abyssinica SIL**.

The Ethiopic script does not require much rendering except for some combining marks for gemination and vowel length. However, there are some glyph variations for the Ethiopic script.

The advanced OpenType capabilities provide access to the variant character forms used in some languages.\n+\n+#### *Why did you remove Graphite from Abyssinica SIL?*\n+Until version 2.300 this font included the Graphite advanced font technology. The OpenType features completely support everything that Graphite supported. Removing Graphite reduces the size of the font and some of the complexities of building the font. \n \n #### *Do you supply a keyboard to use with Abyssinica SIL?*\n \n No keyboards are supplied with the font. However, there are suggested keyboards listed in [Resources](resources).\n \n #### *My language uses variant forms of some Ethiopic characters. How do I type these using the Abyssinica SIL font? How do I use features?*\n \n-You should type the character the same way you would type the standard form of the character. Then, you need to select the variants to be displayed. If your application supports Graphite or the OpenType Character Variant features, you can use these to access the font features built into the font.

See [Font Features](features) page for more details. \n \n #### *Why did you remove the Stylistic Sets from ver. 2.000 of the Abyssinica SIL font?*\n \n Originally we added the Stylistic Sets because there was not a good solution for accessing the glyph variants in the font. At one point we also tried encoding them in the Private Use Area (PUA). PUA characters have now almost all been unencoded since the characters are now either encoded in Unicode or the variants are available through **Character Variants**. The Stylistic Sets were implemented inconsistently, and because of that we chose to remove them rather than attempt to fix them. If you still wish to use a font with Stylistic Sets, ver. 1.500 is still available on the [Previous Versions](previous-versions) page.\n \n #### *I have a copy of the **SIL Abyssinica** font. Can you tell me how this differs from **Abyssinica SIL**?*\n \n-It is best to upgrade to **Abyssinica SIL**. **SIL Abyssinica** (and **SIL Abyssinica U** and **SIL Abyssinica G**) was an early, unreleased version of **Abyssinica SIL**. Although a Unicode font, it only supported Unicode 3.0 and thus had a number of PUA characters in it which have since been added to Unicode 4.1 and 6.0.
