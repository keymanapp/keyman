- Choose a directory containing a .kpj file, and choose the **Terminal > Run Taskâ€¦** menu item, or the **Tasks: Run Task** command.   Select "kpj" and the name, and the compilation should occur in a terminal window.

- You can use the **Developer: Reload Window** command to reload the `[extension development]` window with a new version of the plugin.
