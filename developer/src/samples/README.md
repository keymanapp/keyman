# Samples

The Samples folder contains the following subfolder:

* imsample: The IMSample keyboard implements a simple Input Method Composition
  IMX window, with a DLL interface, supported only on Windows. Documentation on
  the IMX interface can be found at:
  https://help.keyman.com/developer/current-version/guides/develop/imx/

This folder also formerly contained sample keyboards that were distributed with
Keyman Developer; however, the keyboards were very old and no longer useful.

Good sample keyboards can be found in the Keyman Keyboards Repo:
