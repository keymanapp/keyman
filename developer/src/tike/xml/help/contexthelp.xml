  <LanguageReference Name="store" Title="store()">
    <p>The store() statement lets you store a string of characters or keys in a buffer for 
    use elsewhere in the keyboard source file. The store() statement can be used with any() 
    and index() to reduce sets of similar rules down to a single rule. </p><br></br>
    <p>Syntax</p>
    <div class="code">
      store(storeName) value
    </div>
  </LanguageReference>

  <LanguageReference Name="name" Title="&amp;name">
    <p>The &amp;name store lets you give a more descriptive name to your keyboard than just the 
    file name. If &amp;name isn't specified in the keyboard file, Keyman will use the filename 
    of the keyboard, excluding the extension, so the &amp;name statement is optional.</p><br></br>
    <p>Syntax</p>
    <div class="code">
      store(&amp;name) "nameText"
    </div>
  </LanguageReference>

  <LanguageReference Name="version" Title="&amp;version">
    <p>The &amp;version store allows Keyman to distinguish what version of Keyman the keyboard 
    was written for and handle it accordingly. The &amp;version store is optional. For most keyboards, 
    it should be omitted.
    <br></br><br></br>
    If the &amp;version store is omitted, the compiler will infer the lowest version that 
    supports the full set of features used in the keyboard, and assign that version number 
    value to this store internally. The compiler will also report on the version it infers 
    in the compile process.</p><br></br>

    <p>Syntax</p>
    <div class="code">
      begin [entrypoint] > use(startGroup)
    </div>
  </LanguageReference>

  <LanguageReference Name="use" Title="use() statement">
    <p>The use() statement tells Keyman to switch processing to a new group; after Keyman 
    has gone through the new group, and any other nested groups, it will return to the 
    previous one. The use() statement can be used with the match and nomatch rules; it will 
    work the same way.</p><br></br>

  <LanguageReference Name="outs" Title="outs()">
    <p>The outs() statement simply copies the store 'storeName' into the position in which it 
    has been inserted. This can be used in stores, in the context and the output. If the 
    store to be emitted is a single character or virtual key, it can also be used in the 
    key part of the rule.</p><br></br>
    <p>Syntax</p>

  </LanguageReference>

  <LanguageReference Name="any" Title="any()">
    <p>The any() statement will match any character that is in the store 'inputStore'. This 
    statement is only valid on the left side of a rule; the index() statement is used to match 
    again or output the character matched by the any() statement in the output. The any() 
    statement remembers the offset in the store where the match occurred for later use with 
    the index() statement.</p><br></br>
    <p>Syntax</p>
    <div class="code">
      any(inputStore)
    </div>
  </LanguageReference>

  <LanguageReference Name="index" Title="index()">
    <p>The index() statement works together with any() to map an array of characters in 
    'inputStore' to a corresponding array in 'outputStore'. index() can be used in the context 
    and output sections of a rule. If used in the context section, the offset parameter must 
    be less than the offset of the index() statement in the context.</p><br></br>
    <p>Syntax</p>
    <div class="code">
      any(inputStore) > index(outputStore,offset)
    </div>
  </LanguageReference>

  <LanguageReference Name="group" Title="group()">
    <p>The group() statement tells Keyman to start a new set of rules. Keyman supports 
    three sorts of groups: key processing groups, read-only groups, and context processing 
    groups.</p><br></br>
    <p>Syntax</p>
    <div class="code">

      group(groupName) using keys <br></br>
      group(groupName) readonly
    </div>
  </LanguageReference>

  <LanguageReference Name="context" Title="context">
    <p>The context statement reproduces the context stored from the rule match, or a single 
    character of it, into the output. Use the context statement as much as possible as it is 
    significantly faster than using the index statement.</p><br></br>
    <p>Syntax</p>
    <div class="code">
      ... > context <br></br>
      ... > context(offset) <br></br>
      ... context(offset) > ...
    </div>
  </LanguageReference>

  <LanguageReference Name="beep" Title="beep">
    <p>The beep statement produces a beep with the system speaker when the rule is matched. 
    In Keyman Desktop, beep will produce the sound specified by "Asterisk" in Windows Sounds 
    configuration.</p><br></br>
    <p>Syntax</p>
    <div class="code">
      beep

  <LanguageReference Name="nul" Title="nul">
    <p>The nul statement has two purposes: in the output of a rule, it signifies deleting 
    context and keystroke, and at the start of the context it signifies that the context 
    buffer in the application must be empty (or no longer than the context of the rule) in 
    order for the rule to match.</p><br></br>
