## LdmlKeyboardCompiler class

Compiles a LDML keyboard .xml file to a .kmx (KMXPlus), .kvk, and/or .js. The compiler does not read or write from filesystem or network directly, but relies on callbacks for all external IO.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare class LdmlKeyboardCompiler implements KeymanCompiler 
```
**Implements:** KeymanCompiler

## Methods

|  Method | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [init(callbacks, options)](./kmc-ldml.ldmlkeyboardcompiler.init.md) |  | Initialize the compiler, including loading the WASM host for uset parsing. Copies options. |
|  [run(inputFilename, outputFilename)](./kmc-ldml.ldmlkeyboardcompiler.run.md) |  | Compiles a LDML keyboard .xml file to .kmx, .kvk, and/or .js files. Returns an object containing binary artifacts on success. The files are passed in by name, and the compiler will use callbacks as passed to the [LdmlKeyboardCompiler.init()](./kmc-ldml.ldmlkeyboardcompiler.init.md) function to read any input files by disk. |
|  [write(artifacts)](./kmc-ldml.ldmlkeyboardcompiler.write.md) |  | <p>Write artifacts from a successful compile to disk, via callbacks methods. The artifacts written may include:</p><p>- .kmx file - binary keyboard used by Keyman on desktop platforms - .kvk file - binary on screen keyboard used by Keyman on desktop platforms - .js file - Javascript keyboard for web and touch platforms</p> |
