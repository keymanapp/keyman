Used by:
:   <span class="application">Keyman Desktop</span>.

Description:
:   A .KVK file is a Keyman On Screen Keyboard file.

Details:
:   A .KVK file is created in <span class="application">Keyman
    Developer</span> from the Keyman On Screen Keyboard source file
    ([.KVKS](kvks)). Web, Android and iOS keyboards, when compiled,
    embed the .KVK content into the output file, but desktop keyboards
    (Windows and macOS) require the .KVK file to be included with the
    keyboard at distribution time.

Distributed with keyboard:
:   A .KVK file is associated with a specific keyboard, and must be
    distributed with that keyboard to be usable.
