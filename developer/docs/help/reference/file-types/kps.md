Used by:
:   <span class="application">Keyman Developer</span>.

Description:
:   A .KPS file is a Keyman package source file.

Details:
:   A .KPS file is created using the Package Editor in
    <span class="application">Keyman Developer</span>. It specifies what
    files are to be included in the package. It is compiled into a
    Keyman Package file ([.KMP](kmp)).

Distributed with keyboard:
:   No. This is a development file and should not be distributed.

## File format

The optional `<Strings>` section of the file can be included to
customise the text in the bootstrap installer. The default strings are
found in the file:
[strings.xml](https://github.com/keymanapp/keyman/blob/stable-14.0/windows/src/desktop/setup/locale/en/strings.xml).
You can add your own strings for a given package which are used when
compiling as a bundled installer.
