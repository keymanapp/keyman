## Overview

Welcome! In this tutorial, you will learn the basics of Keyman keyboards
and create a simple French keyboard which can be used with any physical
keyboard layout.

The keyboard will use a basic English layout, and add some deadkeys to
define vowel diacritics and a few other characters.

While this tutorial is based on a physical keyboard such as used on a
desktop or laptop computer, the principles of the keyboard language that
you will learn are applicable to developing touch layouts as well.

This keyboard will use Unicode. Unicode is a character encoding standard
that supports most of the world's scripts, and includes support for
user-defined scripts. Unicode is the accepted standard for text encoding
in modern applications and operating systems.

In Keyman Developer keyboard source files, Unicode characters are
specified with `U+xxxx`, where `xxxx` is a four-digit hexadecimal
number.

At the bottom of each page in the tutorial, will be a link to both the
previous page and the next page. You can use these links to work your
way through the tutorial. You may also find links to reference
information, which you can select to learn more about a particular
aspect of creating Keyman keyboards.
