### Introducing Keyman Developer

Keyman Developer is a powerful tool you can use to create custom software keyboards optimized to type in any language you choose. Keyboard authors can distribute their work for desktop, web, tablet and phone, enabling global communities to quickly benefit from keyboards made for their own language.

Keyboards created with Keyman Developer can be used on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and the web.

This tutorial focuses on the Keyman Developer IDE (integrated development environment).
Currently this software is Windows-only, although the command line tools it uses can run on other platforms (such as Linux and macOS).

### Installing Keyman Developer

Keyman Developer is completely free to download and use. You can download it from [https://keyman.com/developer/download](https://keyman.com/developer/download).

On the downloads page, just click the big green “Download Now” button to get the latest version of Keyman. Once you have it, run the `keymandeveloper-a.b.c.exe` file you’ve downloaded. The numbers following “keymandeveloper” indicate which version of Keyman Developer you are installing; you can also see the Keyman Developer version in the main installer window, or after installation, in the Help/About dialog.

After installing Keyman Developer, you should be able to run it on your computer and begin creating projects immediately.

Note that Keyman Developer is a separate app from Keyman, which is the app that lets you use any keyboard created with Keyman Developer.
In order to use the keyboard you create with Keyman Developer, you'll need to have the Keyman app installed on your computer or device.
Keyman is available on the following platforms: Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and the web.
