title: Keyman Developer Walkthrough
---

## Overview

This walkthrough will give you a basic overview of Keyman Developer’s keyboard development and packaging features.

Some tutorials seek to give the reader detailed step-by-step instructions to produce a specific result. The focus is on learning the tool and how to use it. All decisions about what to do with the tool are provided by the tutorial.

Other tutorials seek to present a series of topics and then invite readers to consider how these apply to their own data.

This walkthrough attempts to provide both tutorial approaches. For each topic in the [Table of Contents](#toc-table-of-contents), the first section of that topic will provide a step-by-step guide to producing a keyboard for the Dagbani language. Subsequent sections under that topic will give other examples and discuss alternative approaches that readers can consider for their own data.


To begin the "Step-by-Step" tutorial, start with the [Introduction](00-introduction).
