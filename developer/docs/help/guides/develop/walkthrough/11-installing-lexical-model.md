## Step-by-Step

For the Step-by-Step tutorial, there’s really nothing to do for this page.
This tutorial is for learning only, therefore you don't want to submit this lexical model to the Keyman lexical-models repository.
You could look at other sections on this page if you like.

This concludes the walkthrough. Hopefully it has given you an overview of the entire process.

## Submitting a lexical model to the Keyman Lexical Models Repository

Follow the instructions at [Working with the Keyman Cloud Lexical Models Repository](https://help.keyman.com/developer/lexical-models/) to submit your lexical model to the Keyman lexical models repository. This will enable anyone with Internet access to download and use the lexical model. (Please do not submit the Dagbani lexical model used in the Step-by-Step tutorial. It’s really not suitable for submission to the repository.)

Once the lexical model has been published, any Android or iOS device with Keyman installed and access to the Internet should be able to access and load the lexical model for use with a keyboard with the same language tag (BCP 47 code) as the lexical model.

## Other Distribution Methods

If an Android or iOS device has access to the Keyman package file (.kmp) that contains the lexical model, the Keyman program on the device can load the model. This access could be over the Internet, over a local network or by moving the file to the device’s file storage.

As mentioned earlier, the Keyboard App Builder (KAB) lets you put a Keyman keyboard along with a lexical model into an app for iOS or Android, which can be distributed.
More details can be found on the [Keyboard App Builder](https://software.sil.org/keyboardappbuilder/) page.
