## Overview

Welcome! In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a
[package](../../../reference/file-types/kmp). A package is a collection
of files, compressed into a single file, just like a ZIP file. It is
designed to make installation of keyboards, fonts and related
documentation straightforward for the end user. When done, the package
can be installed into Keyman Desktop through a simple dialog. Keyman for
mobile apps can also download and install keyboards through the keyboard
package.

We will be creating a Khmer Angkor package. You can make your own
package based on the Quick French keyboard from the [keyboard tutorial](../../develop/tutorial).
