title: Advanced Lexical Models Topics
---

> For the following topics, **knowledge of TypeScript or JavaScript is
required**.

The Keyman lexical model engine is capable of much more sophisticated
lexical models than the one described in the [tutorial](../tutorial). To
make advanced models, you will need to modify the [model definition file](model-definition-file), also known as the [`.model.ts` file](../../../reference/file-types/model-ts).

Once you understand how to change the model.ts file, you can attempt
these customizations to an existing wordlist project:

[Changing the default punctuation](punctuation)

[Creating a custom search key function](search-term-to-key)

[Customizing the word breaker](word-breaker)
