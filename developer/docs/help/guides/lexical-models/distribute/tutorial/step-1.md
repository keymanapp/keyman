title: Step 1: What do we include?
---

What is the purpose of a lexical model package? To make installation of
a lexical model as straightforward as possible for the end user. We need
to keep this goal in mind as we work on all the aspects of a package.

A great package will:

1.  Include one lexical model to install.
2.  Include a 'readme.htm' file which describes why the user would install this package.
3.  Include a 'welcome.htm' file which is displayed before/after install.
