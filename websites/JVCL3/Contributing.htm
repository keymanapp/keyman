    <h2>Contributing</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We have more than 300,000 downloads of JVCL from our Website. If
      everyone would volunteer only for one hour a week, we would have
      almost
      300,000 hours a week, or an equivalent of 7500 full-time people
      working
      on this project. And with this we could have tremendous results.
      Think
      about it - only 1 hour a week.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Here's some ways you can contribute:<br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <h4>Writing help</h4>
    <p>Providing help for the components in the library is one of the
      most
      important tasks for us. If you want to participate in writing
      help,
      please go to the <a target="_blank"
        href="http://help.delphi-jedi.org/">JEDI Online Help</a>
      website and start editing the items in that system. Your work will
      make
      it into the system after review. This is the easiest way to
      contribute
      as it only requires an Internet browser and connection. Spending a
      few
      minutes documenting components you use everyday and know well is
      one
      the best way to show us your appreciation. <br>
      Should you want direct access to the files, you should contact the
      <a href="Contact.htm">help
        coordinator</a> for further instructions.<br>
      &nbsp;</p>
    <h4>Donating components</h4>
    <p>The JEDI VCL is built upon donations made by the community. If
      you
      have components that you would like to submit to JVCL then we
      would
      love to receive them. There are few rules that need to be followed
      when
      donating code. They are primarily needed to protect ourselves and
      to
      make the inclusion of your code as efficient and smooth as
      possible:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All code that is submitted will be released under the terms of
        the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/">Mozilla Public
          License</a>.
        By submitting code to JVCL you explicitly agree to it. For more
        information about MPL licensing please read our <a
          href="Licensing.htm">licensing
          page including some FAQ</a>. You can also read the <a
          href="http://www.mozilla.com/MPL/FAQ.html">official MPL FAQ
          from
          Mozilla</a>. We suggest that you at least glance through these
        documents before submitting your code. If you still have
        questions you
        can always contact us. </li>
      <li>Submissions must be your own. If code is not your own, you are
        responsible for making sure that the code is not subject to any
        copyright or license that would prevent the JVCL team to modify
        the
        code and release the resulting code under the terms of the MPL
        license. </li>
      <li>Code must be packaged in a standard zip compatible file. You
        should use the highest compression available. Inside the package
        you
        must include an ASCII text-only readme.txt file which clearly
        states
        your name, your e-mail address, optionally your homepage address
        and
        whether you want to remain anonymous or not. </li>
      <li>After submission, the code may be modified. As a rule, you
        will
        not be contacted for permission to carry out modifications,
        unless you
        are involved in the maintenance of the code. No matter how much
        your
        code is modified, the documentation will at all times reflect
        you as
        being the original author of the code. You will remain the
        copyright
        holder of your code. </li>
      <li>Submitted code is subject to being reformatted to match the
        style
        conventions used throughout the JVCL. Contributors will not be
        forced
        to convert the components to JVCL standard at the time of
        submission,
        but might be requested to do so after the code has been
        accepted&nbsp;
        (i.e, you might recieve a message like: "Your donation has been
        accepted and will be included in JVCL when you have converted it
        to
        JVCL standards"). </li>
      <li>Donation should include a demo program that creates the
        component(s) dynamically (no need to install in Delphi) and
        shows off
        the major properties, methods and events. </li>
      <li>After submission, you should hear from us within two weeks
        about
        the status of your donation. If you haven't, contact one of the
        <a href="Team.htm"> JVCL admins </a>to inquire about the status
        of your
        submission.</li>
      <li>The JVCL is a <i>Visual </i>Component Library. To avoid
        confusion, a class is considered a component when it derives
        from
        TComponent and it's usage requires it to be installed in the IDE
        and to
        be "dropped on a form". These kind of a classes will be included
        in the
        JVCL. If you have classes that are NOT components that you like
        to
        share with the world through Project JEDI, then please consider
        donating it to the&nbsp; <a href="http://jcl.sourceforge.net">JEDI
Code
          Library (JCL)</a> instead. A class that does not need to be
        installed in the IDE, even though it may exhibit some kind of
        visual
        interface at runtime, is not considered a component and is
        perfectly
        acceptable for the JCL. </li>
      <li>All donations to JVCL should be submitted via our <a
          href="ReportBug.htm"> bug tracker</a>.&nbsp; Please select
        category
        "03 Donations", and attach a zip file with your code.</li>
      <li>After your contribution has been accepted, your name should
        appear on our <a href="Contributors.htm">Contributors</a> page.
        If
        your name does not appear there something may have gone wrong
        and you
        should <a href="Contact.htm">contact us</a>.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h4>Writing demos</h4>
    <p>We are always looking for more demos that shows off the
      components
      in JVCL. Writing a demo is also a great way to get to know a
      component.
      If you have demos you would like to donate, submit them through
      the <a href="ReportBug.htm">
        bug tracker</a>. Please select Category "03 Donations", and
      attach a
      zip file with your code. If you write a lot of demos, you might
      get
      developer access to CVS, so you can upload your demos directly.<br>
      &nbsp;</p>
    <h4>Fixing bugs</h4>
    <p>The JVCL is large and there is bound to be bugs in some of the
      components some of the time. If you want to help out fixing bugs,
      log
      in to our
      <a href="ReportBug.htm">bug tracker</a> and take a look at the
      reported
      bugs. If you fix a bug, you can attach it to the bug report along
      with
      a description. If you fix a lot of bugs, you might get developer
      access
      to CVS so you can make updates to the source directly.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>Writing test</h4>
    <p>We need help in writing test code for the components in JVCL. We
      use
      <a href="http://dunit.sourceforge.net/">dunit</a> to write the
      tests.
      To find out what tests are already available, see the <a
        href="https://github.com/project-jedi/jvcl/tree/master/tests/DUnit">tests/DUnit</a>
      folder in GIT or contact <a href="Contact.htm">one of the admins</a>.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>Localizing</h4>
    <p>If you speak another language than english, you can contribute by
      translating the texts in JVCL into other language(s) you know. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Translating JVCL is a matter of creating a copy of the jvcl.po
      file
      in the \locale folder of the JVCL installation and translate it
      using
      poEdit (<a href="http://poedit.sourceforge.net">http://poedit.sourceforge.net</a>).
Once
      you are done, you can upload the translated po file to either our
      <a href="ReportBug.htm">bug tracker</a> or to the jedi.binaries
      newsgroup and a JVCL developer will take care of adding it to CVS.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>Other</h4>
    <p>If you have other skills or ideas on how to improve JVCL, please
      <a href="Contact.htm">contact
        us</a> and we will try to help you make it happen.</p>
