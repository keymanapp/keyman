<h2>Making CVS work with SSH on a Windows machine using TortoiseCVS</h2>
<p>(provided by Peter Thornqvist)
<p>This document explains how to enable SSH (secure shell) access to a remote
CVS repository when running on a MS Windows computer.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Making CVS and CVS with SSH work on a Windows computer can be a daunting
task. With the newest releases of a couple of programs and some clear
instructions, this is not as difficult as it might seem. This document tries to
explain in a step by step, easy to follow manner the tasks you must complete to
make it work on your computer.
<p>With the proliferation of open source projects and the success of the
SourceForge web site, the need for a working CVS/SSH solution on the Windows
platform has become acute for many developers. To set up CVS and SSH, you must
perform the following tasks:
<ul>
  <li>Install the necessary software
  <li>Create public and private keys
  <li>Create SourceForge account
  <li>Upload public key to SourceForge
  <li>Setting environment variables
  <li>Checking out a module using SSH
  <li>Remove the requirement to login</li>
</ul>
<h2>Install the necessary software</h2>
<p>This explanation assumes you are using TortoiseCVS and PuTTY. Note that you
don't need the entire PuTTY package: only puttygen.exe and pageant.exe is used
here.
<p>You can download TortoiseCVS from <a href="http://www.tortoisecvs.org">http://www.tortoisecvs.org</a>.
Make sure you get version 0.53 or later as this version has (almost) automatic
SSH support.
<p>Download PuTTY from <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/</a>.
Either download the entire package or choose the puttygen.zip and the
pageant.zip files. Install the programs to a folder of your own choice. It is a
good idea to put PuTTy in a sub folder of TortoiseCVS.
<h3>Anonymous CVS access</h3>
<p>You should now be able to make anonymous connections to the CVS repository.
TortoiseCVS makes this really simple: go to the SourceForge project you are
interested in and click the CVS link in the menu bar. The CVS page explains how
to setup anonymous CVS access, like this (this example is taken from the JEDI
VCL page on SF, but others look the same):</p>
<div style="BACKGROUND: #FFFFFF; MARGIN-LEFT: 15px">
  <p><b>Anonymous CVS Access</b>
  <p>This project's SourceForge CVS repository can be checked out through
  anonymous (pserver) CVS with the following instruction set. The module you
  wish to check out must be specified as the <i>modulename</i>. When prompted
  for a password for <i>anonymous</i>, simply press the Enter key.
  <p><tt>cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.jvcl.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/jvcl login<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  cvs -z3 -d<span style="BACKGROUND: yellow">:pserver:anonymous@cvs.jvcl.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/jvcl</span>
  co <i>modulename</i></tt></p>
</div>
<p>To checkout, right-click on the folder where you would like to put the files
you are going to check out (a sub folder with the modulename will be created
automatically) and click the CVS Checkout menu item. Copy the yellow selection
above into the CVSROOT edit field like this:
<p align="center"><img height="467" alt="checkout1.gif" src="images/checkout1.gif" width="454">
<p>Notice how TortoiseCVS fills in the other fields automatically for you. The
only thing you have to add yourself is the module name. You can either click the
&quot;Fetch list&quot; button to get all available modules or type in the name
manually. For JVCL3, use dev/JVCL3 as the modulename. <b>Note:</b> module names are <i>case-sensitive!</i>.&nbsp;
<p>Click the OK button and all the modules will be downloaded. If you get a
password prompt, just press ENTER. If you get a prompt asking you if you trust
this server, click Yes.
<h2>Checkout using SSH</h2>
<p>To be able to checkout modules using SSH, you need a SourceForge account,
developer access status to the project and SSH enabled on your computer.
<h2>Enabling SSH</h2>
To enable SSH, you only need to do one thing: add an environment variable. In
Windows NT, right-click the &quot;My computer&quot; icon on the desktop and
select &quot;Properties&quot; from the menu. In the dialog, click the
&quot;Advanced&quot; tab and then the button &quot;Environment variables&quot;.
On the user variables list, click add and enter the following values:
<p>Name - CVS_RSH
<p>Value - ssh.
<p>Click OK and OK to close the dialogs.
<h2>Create SourceForge account</h2>
<p>Now you need a SourceForge account (unless you already have one). Go to
SourceForge (<a href="http://sf.net">http://sf.net</a>) and create a a new user account if necessary. When you've done this,
one of the project admins need to grant you developer access to the project.
<h2>Checking out a module using SSH</h2>
<p>You should now be able to access the project via SSH. The actual command to
checkout via CVS is on the CVS page of the project:
<div style="BACKGROUND: #FFFFFF; MARGIN-LEFT: 15px">
  <p><b>Developer CVS Access via SSH</b>
  <p>Only project developers can access the CVS tree via this method. SSH1 must
  be installed on your client machine. Substitute <i>modulename</i> and <i>developername</i>
  with the proper values. Enter your site password when prompted.
  <p><tt>export CVS_RSH=ssh<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  cvs -z3 -d<span style="BACKGROUND: yellow">:ext:<i>developername</i>@cvs.jvcl.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/jvcl</span>
  co <i>modulename</i></tt></p>
</div>
<p>Doing the same as when you made an anonymous checkout, right-click the folder
where you would like to put the files and select CVS Checkout from the menu.
Paste the selected line above into the CVSROOT field, replace <b>&lt;developername&gt;</b>
with your SourceForge login name and either click Fetch List or enter the module
name manually. Here's how the TortoiseCVS dialog should look like when doing a
SSH checkout (replace <i>peter3</i> with your SF developername)
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/checkout2.gif" width="454" height="467">
<p>You will now be prompted by TortoiseCVS for a password. This is your
SourceForge password. Type it in and press ENTER. The files and folders from the
CVS tree should be created and downloaded on the selected folder.
<h2>Remove the requirement to login</h2>
<p>Constantly entering the password to the CVS repository quickly gets tedious,
but there is a simple way to fix this. By creating a couple of private and
public identity keys with puttygen, you can then use pageant to handle the login
for you. When this is set up correctly, you only need to enter the passphrase in
PageAnt at startup and then all will be automatic.
<h2>Create public and private keys</h2>
<p>Begin by running puttygen.exe and create a new key pair. Save both keys on
your computer (I recommend the TortoiseCVS folder with the names identity.prv and
identity.pub). Note that you don't need to have a passphrase for the keys, but
it is slightly more secure than leaving them empty.
<h2>Upload public key to SourceForge</h2>
<p>You now need to upload your public key to SourceForge so SSH can find it when
you need to login.
<p>To do this, select and copy all the text in the memo field in
puttygen. Next, go to your own page on SourceForge (<a href="https://sourceforge.net/my">https://sourceforge.net/my</a>), login
if prompted to do so and click the <b> Account
Options </b> menu item at the top of the page. Browse to the bottom were it says
<b>Host Access Information</b> and click the <b>[Edit Keys]</b> link. In the new
page, paste the text copied from
puttygen into the memo field and click the <b> Update </b> button.
<h2>Loading your private key automatically</h2>
<h2>Automatic login</h2>
<p>Create a new shortcut on your desktop and make it point to pageant.exe.
Right-click the new link and select Properties. In the Target field, append a
space and the path and filename to the private key file you just saved and
created. Save and double-click the link to start PageAnt. Enter the passphrase
if you use one. Verify that your key has been loaded by right-clicking the
PageAnt icon in the tray and select View Keys: there should be one key in the
list.
<p><b>Tip:</b> copy / move the PageAnt link to the AutoStart/Startup folder to
run PageAnt automatically at boot time.
<p>Now when you Checkout, Update, Diff, Commit etc in CVS projects that require
SSH, you should not have to enter your password. If TortoiseCVS still prompts
you, go over this document again and make sure you've done everything correctly.
If you've downloaded a project using anonymous access and later want to change
to SSH access, it's easiest to completely delete the folder and start from
scratch. If you for some reason can't do that, you could open every Root file
(in the CVS subfolders) with Notepad and manually change the cvs path in them
from :pserver to :ext and try an Update after that.
