<h1><font color="#FF0000">How to get involved?</font></h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 6">We have close to <b><u>60,000</u></b> downloads of
JVCL from our Website. If everyone would volunteer only for one hour a week, we would
    have almost <u><b>60,000 hours a week</b></u>, or an equivalent of <u><b>1500 full-time people
</b> 
    </u> working on this
    project. And with this we could have tremendous results. <u> Think about it -
    only 1 hour a week.</u>&nbsp;<h3 style="margin-bottom: 6"><b><font color="#FF0000">Can you
offer just 1 hour/week to JVCL?</font><br>

<h3><u><a name="How Do I Contribute?">How Can I Contribute?</a></u></h3>
 There are several ways in which you can contribute:
<ul>
  <li>Making suggestions for improvements and <a href="bugs.htm"> submitting
    bugreports</a>.&nbsp;
  <li>Testing the JVCL, writing test cases with <a href="http://dunit.sourceforge.net">DUnit</a>,
    fixing existing <a href="bugs.htm">bugs</a>&nbsp;
  <li>Help file writing. See our &quot;<a href="helpfiles.htm">Guide
    for JVCL Help Writers</a>&quot;
  <li><a href="submitcode.htm">Donating components.</a>&nbsp;
  <li>Development of new components. This is similar to donating code except that it
    will be carried out with a few more restrictions and in a slightly more
    coordinated manner. You can <a href="bugs.htm">submit ideas for new code via
    our Issue Tracker</a> or be assigned to
    develop code based on <a href="wanted.htm"> request received from the
    community</a>.
  <li>Unit owner. In this case you will be assigned to one or more units in the
    JVCL which from that point on will be maintained by you. This means that you
    will be responsible for all modifications made to that unit. For example,
    bug reports and new donations will be forwarded to you for processing.
  <li>Processing donations. This will mean that submitted code will be forwarded
    to you. You factor out routines that can be included in the JVCL, reformat
    them and do some initial testing. After that you forward the code to the
    unit owner in which the new code is to be included.
  <li>This is not an extensive list. If you have other ideas or suggestions: <a href="feedback.htm">contact
    us</a>.</li>
</ul>
