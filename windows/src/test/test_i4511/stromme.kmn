c I have a Norwegian physical keyboard and have specified Norwegian as the Base Keyboard under
c Configuration > Options in Keyman 9.0. But when I use a Keyman keyboard designed for an English
c keyboard, some keystrokes will not produce the correct characters. These are character
c combinations with the ~ (tilde) character (a dead key on the Norwegian keyboard) and in many
c cases also character combinations with the dead keys ` (grave accent) and ^ (circumflex accent).
c Character combinations with the ~ (tilde) character will even make the keyboard freeze so that
c you have to log out from your Windows account and log in again to recover.
