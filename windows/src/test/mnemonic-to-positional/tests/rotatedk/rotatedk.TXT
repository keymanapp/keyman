This keyboard and DLL are setup to rotate the keys Q W E.

Q becomes W
W becomes E
E becomes Q

Also, the apostrophe key has been setup to generate e acute and a acute.

This allows us to verify with the Keyman keyboard that the remapping works correctly.

The Keyman keyboard contains 4 rules:

+ 'q' > 'the-q-key'
+ 'w' > 'the-w-key'
+ 'e' > 'the-e-key'
+ 'a' > 'the-a-key'
+ 'á' > 'the-a-acute-key'
+ 'é' > 'the-e-acute-key'

After applying m-to-p, the remapping should be:

+ [K_QUOTE] > dk(1)
+ [K_E] > 'the-q-key'
+ [K_Q] > 'the-w-key'
+ [K_W] > 'the-e-key'
+ [K_A] > 'the-a-key'
dk(1) + [K_W] > 'the-e-acute-key'
dk(1) + [K_A] > 'the-a-acute-key'
