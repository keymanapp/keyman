This keyboard and DLL are setup to rotate the keys Q W E.

Q becomes W
W becomes E
E becomes Q

This allows us to verify with the Keyman keyboard that the remapping works correctly.

The Keyman keyboard contains 4 rules:

+ 'q' > 'the-q-key'
+ 'w' > 'the-w-key'
+ 'e' > 'the-e-key'
+ 'a' > 'the-a-key'

After applying m-to-p, the remapping should be:

+ [K_E] > 'the-q-key'
+ [K_Q] > 'the-w-key'
+ [K_W] > 'the-e-key'
+ [K_A] > 'the-a-key'

Correct.
