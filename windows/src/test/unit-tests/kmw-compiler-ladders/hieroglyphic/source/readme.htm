<h1>Hieroglyphic Keyboard</h1>

<p style='margin:0px'>Created by Christian Casey</p>

<p>This keyboard is designed as a quick and easy way to enter Ancient Egyptian
  hieroglyphs as Unicode text. Signs are entered using Manuel de Codage
	phonetic values or Gardiner Sign List codes, but they cannot be stacked
	or grouped. The portability of Unicode text produced with this keyboard
	makes it especially suitable for contexts in which rendered
	hieroglyphic text cannot be displayed.</p>
