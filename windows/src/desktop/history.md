* 64-bit Support — Run Keyman Desktop in 64-bit Windows operating systems and applications.
* Language Switcher — Access all your Keyman keyboards, Windows languages and Windows keyboards in one pop-up menu with a single hotkey (by default Alt+LeftShift).
* Universal Language Switching — Switch keyboards once to use the same Keyman keyboard across all applications.
* Keyboard Options — Keyboards for Keyman Desktop 8 can come with options which let you type as you prefer. Options allow you to do things like type French accents before or after the vowel, type Lao with or without spaces, or type Tigrigna with Ethipian or Eritrean punctiaton.
* Enhanced UI — The Keyman interface has been redesigned, from much simpler setup to cleaner, more polished menus and dialogs.
* Enhanced Keyman Menu — Access any tool in the Keyman Toolbox directly from the menu.
* Enhanced On Screen Keyboard — The OSK better mimics your hardware keyboard, matching both the language and layout.
* Enhanced Font Helper — Now see exactly which keyboard characters your fonts support.
* Enhanced Character Map — Support for Planes 1-15 of the Unicode Standard has been greatly improved, as has filtering and search. For example, search now with instant feedback by part or all of character code point or name.
* Support for Unicode 5.2 & 6.0 — Type in everything from Egyptian to Emoji.
* Improved Application Compatibility — The keystroke processor in Keyman Desktop has been made more compatible with major applications such as OpenOffice, Microsoft Office and popular web browsers.
* Single Installer — Both Keyman Desktop Light & Keyman Desktop Professional now install from the same file, which there's no longer any need to worry about downloading the wrong edition. 

## 7.0.0 stable

* The Keyman Font Helper — Lists all currently-installed fonts which work with the active Keyman keyboard.
* The Keyman Usage View — Includes keyboard-specific help, especially useful for layouts with no On Screen Keyboard.
* The Keyman Text Editor with Getting Started Tutorial — Teaches new users how to start using Keyman Desktop.
* Tips & Hints — Assist new users throughout the program.
* Improved Language Linking — Say goodbye to the Language Bar, Keyman Desktop now handles language switching in addition to switching Keyman keyboards.
* Enhanced Keyman Toolbox — Resizable, supports non-Latin Windows keyboards, and improved font-linking.
* Localisable Keyman Menus — Translate the Keyman Desktop user interface into any language.
* Modern COM API — Control all aspects of Keyman Desktop from Windows Scripting, Visual Basic for Applications, or your application!
* Windows Installer (.msi) — Permits straightforward deployment of Keyman Desktop.

## 6.2.0 stable
* Text Services Framework support - Keyman 6.2 supports the new Text Services Framework that is part of Microsoft Office XP. This enables Keyman to integrate with Microsoft Word 2002 much better than previously. Click here for more information.
* Enhanced European keyboard support - Keyman 5.0 required you to use a US English keyboard (QWERTY layout) for full compatibility with Keyman keyboards. Version 6.2 now supports any layout you wish to use, and is not dependent on US English in any way.
* Visual keyboards - An on-screen and printable keyboard is now available for Keyman 6.2 keyboards.
* Add-ins - Keyman now supports add-ins for other applications. Included with Keyman 6.2 are add-ins for Word and RichEdit. The RichEdit add-in does not require RichEdit 3.0.
* Enhanced integration with Windows languages - It is now possible to switch Keyman keyboards on automatically when a language is selected as a non-Administrative user.

## 5.0.0 stable
* Unicode support - With the release of version 5.0, Keyman now includes full support for Unicode. Unicode is a character encoding standard that supports most of the world's more common scripts, and includes support for user-defined scripts. Keyman 5.0 keyboards now support input and output of any of the thousands of characters defined in Unicode, including characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane which are encoded with surrogate pairs.
* Integration with Windows - Keyman 5.0 integrates more tightly with the multilingual features of Windows 9x, Me, NT, and 2000. Keyman 5.0 also features full shell integration, so that you can install a keyboard by simply double-clicking on its icon in Windows Explorer.
* Keyman Developer- From version 5.0 and up, the Keyman Developer (previously TIKE) is a separate application, which must be downloaded and registered independently. This simplifies the deployment of Keyman on the majority of systems, where keyboard development is not required. See the Keyman Developer website for more information.
