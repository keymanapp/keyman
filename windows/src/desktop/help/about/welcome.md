Thank you for installing Keyman. Whether you're a new or returning user,
we believe you will appreciate the significant enhancements in this
latest version of Keyman.

**What is Keyman?**

Keyman is a keyboard application that makes it easy for you to type in
your language in all your favourite Windows programs and across the Web.
Keyman is used by more than a million people to type in over 1000
languages and counting.

Keyman remaps your hardware keyboard to any one of hundreds of virtual
keyboards, available for download from the [Keyman
Website](https://keyman.com/) and around the Web. If you cannot find a
keyboard for your language, we offer the companion application [Keyman
Developer](https://keyman.com/developer/). Keyman Developer is a
powerful software solution for creating the perfect Keyman keyboard to
suit your needs.

Keyman features seamless integration with your Windows operating system
and the Windows language bar. You can use Keyman keyboards with Keyman
in almost any Windows or Web application. Try it in office software like
Word or Excel; browsers like Firefox or Internet Explorer; design
programs like Adobe InDesign; and email services like Outlook or Gmail.

Keyman fully supports [Unicode](http://www.unicode.org/) and legacy
standards and can be used with all standard hardware keyboards, making
it the perfect solution for typing in any language on your computer.
