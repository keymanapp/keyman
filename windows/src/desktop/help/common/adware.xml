  <title>Does Keyman include adware or spyware?</title>
  <para>No!</para>
  <para>We never have and never will include adware or spyware components. Keyman Desktop does contact the keyman.com website periodically to check for updates for both Keyman Desktop and the keyboards you have installed. In this process, the only information communicated is the current version of Keyman Desktop and the version of the keyboards. You can switch this option off in Keyman Configuration.</para>
