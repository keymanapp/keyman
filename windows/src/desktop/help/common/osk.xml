  <title>Does Keyman include a virtual on-screen keyboard?</title>
  <para>Yes. However, some of the Keyman keyboards available on our website do not currently include an On Screen Keyboard. To know if a keyboard download includes an On Screen Keyboard, look for the <inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="desktop_images/icon-osk.png"></imagedata></imageobject></inlinemediaobject> icon in the Keyman keyboard downloads list.</para>
  <para>To check if an installed keyboard includes an On Screen Keyboard, start Keyman Configuration, navigate to the Keyboards tab, and expand the details for the keyboard.  The
On Screen Keyboard entry in the details will give more information on whether or not an On Screen Keyboard is available for the selected keyboard.</para>
