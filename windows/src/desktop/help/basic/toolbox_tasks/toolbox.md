**Opening the Keyman Toolbox**

To display the Keyman Toolbox:

1.  Click on the Keyman icon ![](desktop_images/icon-keyman.png), on the
    Windows Taskbar near the clock.

2.  From the Keyman menu, select On Screen Keyboard.

**Note:**
The Keyman Toolbox is displayed by default in the last position it was
used. It will be displayed initially in the bottom right hand corner of
the screen.

**Note:**
The Keyman Toolbox opens automatically when you select a Keyman keyboard
layout. You can change this behaviour in the

Options tab

of Keyman Configuration.

**Using the Keyman Toolbox**

Along the top of the Keyman Toolbox is a toolbar.

You can move the Keyman Toolbox around your screen by clicking and
dragging anywhere on the Keyman Toolbox toolbar not covered by a button.

You can resize the Keyman Toolbox by clicking and dragging on a corner
of the Keyman Toolbox.

**Note:**
When the On Screen Keyboard tool is selected, the Keyman Toolbox will
only resize according to the proportions of the keyboard.

**Toolbox Options**

![](desktop_images/toolbox-options.png)

Right click on the Keyman Toolbox to display a menu with the following
options:

+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| Fade When       | If this option is enabled, the Keyman Toolbox       |
| Inactive        | appears partially transparent when the mouse is not |
|                 | over it.                                            |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| Show Toolbar    | This option hides or displays the toolbar at the    |
|                 | top of the Keyman Toolbox.                          |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| Save as Web     | This option saves the keyboard view of the current  |
| Page\...        | keyboard layout as a web page for easy reference.   |
|                 | The new web page will include diagrams for every    |
|                 | state of the current keyboard layout, including     |
|                 | shift states.                                       |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| Print\...       | This option prints the keyboard view of the current |
|                 | keyboard layout for easy reference. The printout    |
|                 | will include diagrams for every state of the        |
|                 | current keyboard layout, including shift states.    |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------+

**Toolbox Hints**

![](desktop_images/toolbox-hints.png)

At the bottom of the Keyman Toolbox, a hint bar shows handy tips on how
to use Keyman and access some of the more advanced features available.
The hint bar will slowly cycle through the available hints, or you can
use the arrow buttons on the right of the hint bar to cycle through the
hints yourself.

You can close the hint bar by clicking the X icon on the right hand side
of the hint bar. This X icon is not the same as the Close Keyman Toolbox
button at the top of the window!

To access the hint bar again, open the [Options tab](#basic_options_tab)
of Keyman Configuration and click Reset Hints.
