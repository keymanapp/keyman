title: How To - Make the Keyman icon visible
---

If the Keyman icon is not on the Windows Taskbar near the clock, click
the arrow or triangle near the clock:

-   You will see a collection of icons. If the Keyman icon
    (![](../desktop_images/icon-keyman.png)) is not in this collection,
    Keyman is not running.

-   If the Keyman icon is in this collection, you can optionally
    move it permanently to the Windows Taskbar, to make it more
    easily accessible. However, Keyman will run correctly even if
    the icon is left in this collection.

## Move the icon with the mouse

You can move the Keyman icon simply by dragging it down to the Taskbar
notification area with your mouse.

## Move the icon using Windows Settings
