**Turning on a Keyboard by switching Windows languages**

Because Keyman keyboards are always associated with a Windows language,
turning on that Windows language will automatically turn on the Keyman

multiple Keyman keyboards are associated with the language, an extra
icon will appear next to the Windows language that will allow you to
choose the keyboard you want to use.
