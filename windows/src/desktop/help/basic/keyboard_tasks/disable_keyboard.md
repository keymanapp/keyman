Keyman keyboards can be enabled and disabled.

**Disabling a Keyman keyboard**

Disabling a Keyman keyboard removes it from the Keyman menu and Keyman
Toolbox but does not uninstall the keyboard. This is useful if:

-   You are using a single keyboard layout from a package with multiple
    keyboards and you want to remove the extra keyboards from the Keyman
    Toolbox and menu.

-   You have a keyboard layout installed which you aren\'t currently
    using but don\'t want to uninstall.

To disable a Keyman keyboard:

1.  Open Keyman.

2.  Click on the Keyman icon ![](desktop_images/icon-keyman.png), on the
    Windows Taskbar near the clock.

3.  Select Configuration.

4.  Select the Keyboard Layouts tab.

5.  Untick the checkbox beside the Keyman keyboard.

6.  Click OK.

When a keyboard layout is disabled, its name appears in grey and its
checkbox is unticked.
