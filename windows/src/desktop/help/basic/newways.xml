  <title>New Ways to Use Keyman Desktop</title>
  
  <para>If you are an existing user of Keyman Desktop, you will notice that some parts of the program have changed. This 
  topic describes some of the new ways you can or should access some of Keyman Desktop's features. These changes have been 
  implemented as part of enhancing how Keyman Desktop integrates with modern versions of Windows.</para>
  
  <!--New ways in Keyman Desktop 10.0 should replace this section.-->
  <para>The key change in your usage will be how you access keyboard layouts. With version 9.0 and later, all keyboard layouts are
  registered as Windows Text Services, and are always available through Windows language interfaces as well as with the
  <link linkend="basic_traymenu">Keyman menu</link>, 
  <link linkend="basic_languageswitcher">language switcher</link> and 
  <link linkend="basic_hotkeys_tab">hotkeys</link>.</para>
  
  <para><xref linkend="basic_enable_keyboard"></xref></para>
  
  <para>When you install a keyboard layout, it will be registered under the language for which the keyboard has been designed,
  or if this has not been specified by the keyboard designer, then it will be installed under your default language. You can
  always change the language registration in the <link linkend="basic_keyboards_tab">Keyboards tab</link>.</para>
  
  <para>In earlier versions of Keyman Desktop, language association was controlled in the Languages tab in Keyman Desktop Configuration.
  With the new model of keyboard registration, all language association is controlled in the Keyboards tab. Each keyboard can be associated with multiple languages.</para>
  
  <para>The keyboard menu now shows all Windows languages and keyboards, and not just Keyman keyboards. This reflects the tight integration
  with Windows languages that Keyman Desktop 10 provides.</para>
  
  <para>You may be using a non-US hardware keyboard, which we call the Base Layout.  For example, you may be using a French, or German, or
  other European Latin-script keyboard.  You can change the base layout in the Options tab, which will allow Keyman to automatically
  generate new versions of your keyboards that adapt to your base layout.</para>
