title: How To - Fix A Problem with an Active Keyman Keyboard Not Typing
---

## Symptoms
You may experience an issue in Windows 7 where:
* Keyman is on; and
* your Keyman keyboard is active, your Keyman keyboard is active, with its icon showing in the Keyman menu; but
* your Keyman keyboard does not work.

## Resolution
Unhide the Keyman menu as described in [Step 2](../start/tutorial#step-2-) of the Getting Started tutorial.

This can also be resolved by switching language using the Windows Language Bar or the Language Icon

## Background
When the Keyman icon is in the hidden notification area of the Windows taskbar, opening the notification area and selecting the icon causes it to change the keyboard for the taskbar, not for your active application. Clicking back to the active application results in the keyboard turning off again.
