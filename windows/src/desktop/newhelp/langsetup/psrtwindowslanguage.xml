  <para>Keyman Desktop will detect when you need to install a Windows language.  It will automatically install the language in Control Panel/Regional and Language Options, and     link the relevant Keyman Desktop keyboard layout to that language.</para>
  <para>After Keyman Desktop has installed the language, you will see the new language listed in the<glossterm>Language Bar</glossterm>. You may choose to switch keyboard layouts using the Language Bar or using the <link linkend="context_traymenu">Keyman Desktop menu</link>.  Keyman Desktop will     automatically manage the link between the Windows language and the Keyman Desktop keyboard layout.</para>
