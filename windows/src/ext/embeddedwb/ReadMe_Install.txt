EmbeddedWB Component Pack
=============================================================

bsalsa productions develop freeware solutions for users and programmers under "Borland Delphi" with "Microsoft Windows" OS. 
Our main product is the Embedded Web Browser component package. 
Most of its components were originally developed by Per Linds? Larsen. 
Our package gives you a complete solution to develop and control Internet based applications. 
It allows you to create a customized Web browsing application, add Internet, file and network browsing, document viewing, 
and data downloading capabilities to your applications.
In the package there are many components that answer the needs of the programmer 
from Internet web browsers, to applications web updating.
The components support all Borland Delphi versions from Delphi 5 to Delphi XE and we update our components often on a weekly basis.
Our guiding line is  easy use and implementation so, all the components are under one tab and the code 
implementation in with one line of code! In the package, we included a full featured demos so that programmers can easily 
understand "how to do what".

Our major goals are:

* Fast.
* Handy.
* Small.
* Freeware.
