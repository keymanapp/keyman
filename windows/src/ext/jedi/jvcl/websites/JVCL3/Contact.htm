    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The JVCL is built by the community, but more importantly, for the
      community. Therefore we would like to hear from you. If you have
      any
      problems, comments or suggestions we would appreciate it if you
      would
      drop us a note. There are several ways to get in contact with us.
      <br>
      Note that we also like to hear about you if everything is fine, as
      this
      will let us know that what we do is appreciated.<br>
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>Newsgroups</h4>
    <p>The newsgroups are the most active forums for discussing the JVCL
      (and other JEDI related topics) and is also the place where the
      JVCL
      developers hang out. The JVCL specific group is called jedi.vcl,
      but
      you are recommended to also subscribe to at least jedi.general,
      jedi.jcl and jedi.binaries.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>Web gateway</h4>
    <p>If you can't access the newsgroups directly (because of firewalls
      or
      company policy), there is also a
      <a href="http://newsportal.delphi-jedi.org/">web
        gateway to the newsgroups</a>.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>Mailing lists</h4>
    <p>We also have a couple of mailing lists on Yahoo, but the activity
      is
      very low:</p>
    <p><a
        href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/jvcl-general">JEDI-VCL</a></p>
    <p><a
        href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/jvcl-announce">JVCL-Announce</a></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>Bug tracker</h4>
    <p>The bug tracker can be used to provide feedback, suggest
      improvements or donate code as well as reporting bugs:</p>

    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>Contacting individual developers</h4>
    <p>We do not encourage direct contact with team members unless you
      have
      specific reason to. Please use the above forums as much as
      possible.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If you still think you need to contact a developer, you can find
      the
      e-mails of all JVCL developer at the
      <a
