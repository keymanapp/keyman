@@TJvScreenCanvas.Canvas
Summary
  Provides access to the drawing area of the screen.
Description
  TJvScreenCanvas allows drawing on the screen by providing a TCanvas object for this purpose. Drawing
  on the canvas effectively modifies the screen image pixels. Any canvas operation is valid - not just
  Draw and StretchDraw - including line drawing, rectangles, and circles.

  A canvas object is created automatically for TJvScreenCanvas by calling BeginPaint, and the property
  is read-only.
