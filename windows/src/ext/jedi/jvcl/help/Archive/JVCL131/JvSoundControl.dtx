<TITLE TJvSoundControl overview>
<GROUP JVCL.Miscel>
  TJvSoundControl enables you to change the balance and volume of output devices. 
  
  Use TJvSoundControl to change the balance or volume of output devices. TJvSoundControl has three 
  properties that describe output devices:
  
  * Cd, the first auxiliary output device available on your system, usually the CD audio 
    output from a CD-ROM drive. 
  * Midi, the first MIDI output device available on your system.
  * Wave, the first waveform device available on your system.
  
  These properties all have a Balance and Volume property, which can be used to change the balance
  and volume of these devices.

@@TJvSoundControl.Create
Summary
  Creates and initializes an instance of TJvSoundControl.
Description
  Call Create to create an instance of TJvSoundControl at runtime. A TJvSoundControl component placed on a 
  form at design time is created automatically.

  Pass a single Component as a parameter to provide the control with an Owner that is responsible
  for freeing it.
Parameters
  AOwner - The owner for the instance of TJvSoundControl.

@@TJvSoundControl.Destroy
Summary
  Destroys an instance of TJvSoundControl.
Description
  Do not call Destroy directly in an application. Instead, call Free. Free verifies that the 
  TJvSoundControl object is not nil and only then calls Destroy.
Parameters
  None.

@@TJvSoundControl.Cd
Summary
  Contains information about the first auxiliary output device available on your system.
Description
  Access Cd at runtime to view and set volume and balance of the first auxiliary output device
  available on your system dynamically (at design time use the object inspector to set the 
  properties of Cd). 
  
  Auxiliary audio devices are audio devices whose output is mixed with the MIDI and waveform-audio 
  output devices in a multimedia computer. An example of an auxiliary audio device is the CD audio 
  output from a CD-ROM drive.

@@TJvSoundControl.LastError
Summary
  Read LastError to determine if the last operation was successfull.
Description
  Read LastError after getting or setting a value to property Balance or Volume, to determine if the
  operation was successfull. LastError returns MMSYSERR_NOERROR if the last operation was successful
  or an error otherwise. Possible error values include the following:
  <TABLE>
    Value                   Description
    -----                   -----------
    MMSYSERR_INVALHANDLE    Specified device handle is invalid.
    MMSYSERR_NODRIVER       No device driver is present.
    MMSYSERR_NOMEM          Unable to allocate or lock memory.
    MMSYSERR_NOTSUPPORTED   Function isn't supported.

  available on your system dynamically (at design time use the object inspector to set the 
  properties of Midi).

@@TJvSoundValue
<GROUP TJvSoundValue>
Summary
  TJvSoundValue describes an output device on your system.
Description
  Use the properties of an TJvSoundValue to:

  * Find or set the volume of a device. 
  * Find or set the balance between the left and right volume of a device.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvSoundValue.Create
Summary
  Creates and initializes an instance of TJvSoundValue.
Description
  Applications should not call Create directly. A TJvSoundValue is created automatically by a
  TJvSoundControl for the first auxiliary output device, the first MIDI output device and the first
  waveform device available on your system.
Params
  AOwner - The owner for the instance of TJvSoundValue.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvSoundValue.Balance
Summary
  Specifies the balance between the left and right volume of a device.
Description
  Use Balance to find or set the balance between the left and right volume. The value for this property 
  must be a number from 0 (only right) to 100 (only left).
  
  Use <LINK TJvSoundControl.LastError, LastError> to determine if the operation was successfull.

@@TJvSoundValue.GetValue
Summary
  Gets the values of the Balance and Volume property.
Description
  Applications can’t call the protected GetValue method. A TJvSoundControl calls GetValue if a user
  sets property Balance or Volume.
Parameters
  None.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvSoundValue.Handle
Summary
  Identifies the output device descriped by TJvSoundValue.
Description
  Applications can’t use Handle. It's used internally by TJvSoundValue and TJvSoundControl.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvSoundValue.OnRefresh
Summary
  Occurs when the values of Balance or Volume needs to be refreshed.
Description
  Applications can’t use OnRefresh. It's used internally by TJvSoundValue and TJvSoundControl.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvSoundValue.OnUpdate
Summary
  Occurs when the user changes the values of Balance or Volume.
Description
  Applications can’t use OnUpdate. It's used internally by TJvSoundValue and TJvSoundControl.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvSoundValue.SetValue
Summary
  Sets the values of the Balance and Volume property.
Description
  Applications can’t call the protected GetValue method. A TJvSoundControl calls SetValue if a user
  reads property Balance or Volume.
Parameters
  Vol - Determines the new values of Balance and Volume.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvSoundValue.Volume
Summary
  Specifies the volume of a device.
Description
  Use Volume to find or set the volume of a device. The value for this property must be a number from 
  0 (silence) to 255 (maximum volume).
  
  Volume settings are interpreted logarithmically. This means the perceived volume increase is the same 
  when increasing the volume level from 50 to 60 as it is from 40 to 50.

  Use <LINK TJvSoundControl.LastError, LastError> to determine if the operation was successfull.
