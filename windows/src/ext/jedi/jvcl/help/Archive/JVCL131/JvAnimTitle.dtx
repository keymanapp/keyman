<TITLE TJvAnimTitle overview>
<GROUP JVCL.Miscel>
  TJvAnimTitle is a component to provide an animated form caption. The component handles two things:

  * Animate the caption (the caption slowly appears and then disappears).
  * Allow the caption to blink <I>x</I> time after the caption has appeared.

  To use this component you should:

  * Drop TJvAnimTitle on a form
  * Set the <LINK TJvAnimTitle.Title, Title> to the title to display (by default set to the forms
    Caption. Changes to the forms Caption are not mirrored in this property).
  * Set the delay between two animation steps.
  * Optionally set Blink to the number of blinks after the title is fully displayed or leave it at
    0 if you don't want the caption to blink.
