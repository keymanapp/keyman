This package contains a couple of components and some classes for design support,
a demo and a registration units.

Run-time:

JvPageLinkTreeView.pas
Contains the components TJvPageListTreeView, TJvPageList, TJvSettingsTreeView
and their TCustom variants. For more info on each, read the source (Luke)


Design-time:

JvPageLinkTreeviewReg.pas/.dcr
Registration units for components as well as property and component editors.


JvTreeItemsEditor.pas/.dfm

Since I wanted to derive the treeview from TCustomTreeView and
still retain the behaviour of a normal treeview at design-time (double-click to open
the Items Editor) and couldn't find the unit where this editor is
implemented, I had to make my own. This editor have some advantages
compared to the standard editor: the dialog is resizable, the images from the 
imagelists are drawn in the appropriate combobox,  you can Load *and* Save the
Items...

One other benefit is that the registration file registers this editor for the
TCustomTreeView class, so if you install it you will have automatic access to
this editor from any TCustomTreeView derived component (except those derived from
TTreeView directly since the standard editor is registered for that component)

The ImageIndex property editor relies on a new editor in JcDsgnEditors, JvImageIndexDefaultProperty. If you get an error that thi class cannot be found, you need to download the latest JvDsgnEditors.pas from jvcl.sourceforge.net

JvPageLinkEditor.pas/.dfm
Contains a property editor for the PageLinks property in TJvCustomPageListTreeView

Since these components doesn't work with anything below D6, I haven't bothered to insert any IFDEF's to cater for it, nor inlcuded the JVCL.INC file.
