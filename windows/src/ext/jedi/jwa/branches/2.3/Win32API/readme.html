  <h2>What has changed?</h2>

  <h3>December 2007</h3>
  <p>Warning: This file is out of date and is not maintained at the moment. Refer to the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jedi-apilib/">projects website</a>
    for more information.</p>

  <h3>January 2005</h3>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Win32 API Conversion was moved to sourceforge.</li>
    <li>Removed JwaLM, the Lan Manager conversion from Petr. Use the JwaLM*.pas files instead</li>
    <li>Added externalsym directives where they were missing</li>
    <li>Added dynamic linking support where it was missing</li>
    <li>WinDefines.inc was replaced with jedi.inc ad jediapilib.inc. This creates a structuring like in the JCL and JVCL</li>    
    <li>Many conditional directives have been changed. See ifdef.html for initial documentation</li>
    <li>Cleanup of source files. Robert has done a lot of work to clean up the conversions, resulting in meaner and cleaner sources</li>
  </ul>
  </p>


  <h2>Note about dynamic linking</h2>
  <p>
  All conversions (except those functions that use the cdecl calling convention
  support dynamic loading through the DYNAMIC_LINK conditional directive (see ifdef.html).
  By default this feature is turned off.

  Please note that currently there is no way to find out upfront whether or not a
  required library is present on the system other than explicitly testing this
  yourself using LoadLibrary(), a future release might add support for this. In
  case the required library is not present on the system, an exception is raised.
  The exception is either EJwaLoadLibraryError or EJwaGetProcAddressError (both
  defined in JwaWinType and descended from EJwaError) if LoadLibrary() or
  GetProcAddress() fails respectively. Therefor, you'll need to protect your API
  calls using a try...except block like this:<br>

  <pre class=syntax>
  var
    H: HANDLE;
  begin
    try
      H := CreateFile(...);
      if H <> INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE then
      begin
        ...
        CloseHandle(H);
      end;
    except
      on EJwaError do
      begin
        // Either CreateFile or CloseHandle could not be found, handle that
        // situation somehow.
      end;
    end;
  end;
  </pre>

  <h2>Known issues</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>All functions with the cdecl calling convention do not yet support dynamic 
        linking. This mostly involves JwaWinBer and JwaWinLdap but there exist a few
        other instances.</li>
    <li>There are still plenty of TODO markers :-(</li>
    <li>The JwaAdsTLB unit has a few errors. This is a type library import and the
        errors are a result of bugs in the Delphi type library importer, not mine.
        Thanks to Chris Burr for pointing this out, sorry Chris but I haven't had
        time to fix it yet.</li>
    <li>There's a problem using these units in Delphi 4. The problem is that in some places 
  I use constant declarations like this:<br>
  RESTORE_LAST_ERROR_NAME_W = WideString('RestoreLastError');<br>
  which cause access violations at compile time. The work around is to change these
  constants to:<br>
  RESTORE_LAST_ERROR_NAME_W : PWideChar = 'RestoreLastError';<br>
  When I have time I'll change this, until then at least you know...Thanks to 
  Roman Grycz (Romek?) for reporting this.</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Installation</h2>

  The Win32 interface units do not need explicit installation but you do need to
  make sure that Delphi can find them. There are two ways to accomplish this,
  using Project Options or Environment Options. First you need to extract the zip
  into a directory of your liking, we'll refer to this directory as $(WIN32API).
  Now follow either of the steps outlined in the next two sections.

  <h4>Using Project Options</h4>

  From the IDE menu select "Project > Options" and switch to the
  "Directories/Conditionals" page in the dialog that appears. Find the edit box
  labelled "Search Path", type in the $(WIN32API) path and select OK. Alternatively
  you can use the ellipsis button to navigate to the directory in question. You
  will need to repeat this for every new project you start that uses the Win32 API
  interface units.

  <h4>Using Environment Options</h4>

  From the IDE menu select "Tools > Environment Options" and switch to the "Library"
  page in the dialog that appears. Find the edit box labelled "Library Path", it
  should contain something along the lines of "$(DELPHI)\Lib;$(DELPHI)\Bin;$(DELPHI)\Imports;$(DELPHI)\Projects\Bpl".
  Change this to include the $(WIN32API) directory. For example, assuming you've
  unzipped the Win32Api.zip file to "c:\win32api":<br>
  "$(DELPHI)\Lib;$(DELPHI)\Bin;$(DELPHI)\Imports;$(DELPHI)\Projects\Bpl;c:\win32api".
  Don't forget to seperate using a semicolon. You don't have to manually edit this
  string, you can press the ellipsis button to navigate to the $(WIN32API) directory
  and add it automatically. After pressing OK Delphi will be able to find the units
  for every new project without the need to specify the directory again.

  <p>
  If you performed the steps above you can start using the units in your application
  by including the appropriate ones in your uses clause. I personally prefer to
  use Project Options instead of Environment Options to avoid problems. One known
  problem is that when you use the Enironment Options method, you might get compiler
  errors when trying to build the JEDI Code Library.

  <h2>Using the units</h2>

  When you use these interface units keep in mind that they duplicate a lot of
  what's in the interface units that ship with Delphi, such as Windows.pas. These
  units can co-exist but you need to make sure that you do not mix the usage of them
  too much. For example, either use Windows.pas or the equivalents in this library
  but not both, otherwise you might run into incompatibilities between them resulting
  in compile errors. The easiest way is to not include both in the uses clause of
  your own units. If this is impossible for some reason you're best of using explicit
  unit qualification when using anything. For example, instead of using "CreateProcess"
  use either "Windows.CreateProcess" or "JwaWinBase.CreateProcess". If you do not use
  unit qualification you end up using the one from the unit last mentioned in the
  uses clause.

  <p>
  The most common error you're likely to encounter is:
  "Incompatible types: 'System.WideChar' and 'JwaWinType'.WideChar" where WideChar
  is only an example. This is due to the fact that the RTL (e.g. System.pas or
  Windows.pas) defines the type WideChar differently from WinType.pas. To solve
  this simply change the declaration in JwaWinType.pas to become an alias for the
  type in System.pas (or Windows.pas). For example
  Before:
  <pre class=syntax>
  <b>type</b>
    DWORD = Longword;
  </pre>
  After:
  <pre class=syntax>
  <b>type</b>
    DWORD = Windows.DWORD;
  </pre>
  If you look inside JwaWinType.pas you see that I've already done this for the most
  common types (using conditional compilation) like this
  <pre class=syntax>
  <b>type</b>
    DWORD = {$IFDEF USE_DELPHI_TYPES}Windows.DWORD{$ELSE}Longword{$ENDIF};
  </pre>
  therefore it's unlikely you'll run into this problem. However, if you do please
  notify me so I can update the interface units.

  <p>
  Please note that these units heavily use conditional compilation. You can
  globally change some settings, and thereby determine how they get compiled,
  through the WinDefines.inc include file. An example of this would be to specify
  an unicode build. There are a few more directives which cannot be set globally
  (yet), Initial documentation for the directives can be found in ifdef.html.

  <h2>Copyright</h2>

  These units are distributed under the terms of of the MPL, or optionally the
  terms of the LGPL. What this means is that they are completely free and can
  be used in all development, even commercial applications. I have a few requests
  though:
  <ul>
    <li>Please redistribute only using the MPL/LGPL dual license eventhough you
        are legally allowed to redistribute using only MPL or LGPL.

        you understand your rights and obligations.
  </ul>
  <p>
  Please be aware that the WinLDAP unit was created by Luk Vermeulen and can only
  be used and distributed under the MPL license. It's included because of dependencies
  on this unit. We may convert the header ourselves one day.
