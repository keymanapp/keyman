This is the preview Version of RunAsSys 1.1 for Windows 200, XP, Vista and Win7 made with the help of JWSCL.
RunAsSys runs application as SYSTEM user in the current user's session. If you start it without any parameters
it creates a command prompt with SYSTEM privileges by default. Otherwise you can add an application with parameters to start this process as SYSTEM user. Use quotation marks if necessary for your path.
On Windows Vista and UAC it should prompt you for elevation. On XP without Admin privileges it should prompt you for Admin credentials.


Additional Info:
There are two version of a reg file: 32bit and 64bit. They allow you to activate the log mechanism. Leave the RegPath empty and the reg files
will be written where the EXE-files resides.

SuRun Support:
If SuRun (http://kay-bruns.de/wp/software/surun) is installed on the system, RunAsSys asks SuRun to get Administrator access 
and falls back if something bad happens.
If you hold the shift key while you start RunAsSys, SuRun is ignored and the Administrator's password is asked.
You don't need SuRun to use RunAsSys!
