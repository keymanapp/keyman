Installation notes
------------------

TRegExpr has not been updated to Delphi 2010.  This is therefore the master copy.

Build notes
-----------

TRegExpr does not include its own package, as it does not include any components.  The Delphi search path is set during the build.

PlusMemo includes its own version of TRegExpr.  We will use this version as the master version, for now, as we are not using the RegExpr unit from PlusMemo (it is used only by RegExHilit.pas).
