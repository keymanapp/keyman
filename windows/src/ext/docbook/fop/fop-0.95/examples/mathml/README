FOP MathML Readme

This directory contains an extension for MathML that can be used with FOP.

This extension works with JEuclid which is available from:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/jeuclid/

This simply uses JEuclid to convert the MathML CML into SVG.
The SVG is then handled as normal.

Building the MathML extension:
To build the MathML extension, please download JEuclid using the link above.
Put the jeuclid.jar into the lib directory and run the Ant build script in
this directory.

Usage:
When you've built the MathML extension, add jeuclid.jar and 
build/mathml-fop.jar to the classpath used when running FOP. You can then
simply use MathML directly in fo:instream-foreign-object elements or 
reference a MathML file in fo:external-graphic elements as shown in 
the demo file: docs/mathml.fo
