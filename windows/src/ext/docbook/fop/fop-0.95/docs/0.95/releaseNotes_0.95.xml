          <title>Notes</title>
          <p>
            Besides the important changes listed below, the most important areas with
            improvements in this release are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Many bugfixes in tables, plus some new features (full support for keeps and
              breaks, border conditionality, background on columns and header/footer/body)
            </li>
            <li>
              Improvements and bugfixes for font handling and font
              auto-detection/-registration.
            </li>
            <li>
              Performance improvements and memory optimizations for the property handling
              in the FO tree.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Please note that with this release, we've dropped support for Java 1.3.
            FOP will, from now on, <strong>require at least Java 1.4</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            There have been a few changes in tables that make FOP both more strict and more
            compliant to the Recommendation:
            <ul>
              <li>XSL-FO 1.1 explicitly states that a row-spanning fo:table-cell element is not
                allowed to span further than its enclosing fo:table-header/footer/body element
                (see bottom of <link href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xsl11/#fo_table">section
                  6.7.3</link>). From now on FOP will give a validation error if a document
                contains such an erroneous cell.
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>If an fo:table element contains explicit fo:table-column children, then those
                  elements set the total number of columns in the table. This means that a
                  validation error will now occur if a row contains more cells than available
                  columns. This change allows to improve performance, since the rendering of the
                  table may start as soon as the table-column elements have been parsed.</p>
                <p>If more flexibility is needed, then the fo:table-column elements may be just
                  omitted. The final number of columns will then be set by the row that has the
                  most cells.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            The image libraries Jimi and JAI are no longer needed (and used) for image loading.
            Instead we rely completely on the Image I/O API that has been introduced with
            Java 1.4. If you still need support for bitmap image formats that do not work
            out-of-the-box, we recommend adding
            <link href="http://jai-imageio.dev.java.net/">JAI Image I/O Tools</link>
            (an Image I/O compatible image codec package) to the classpath. JAI is still required
            for building the FOP distribution but it is optional for normal builds and at run-time.
          </p>
