          <title>Notes</title>
          <p>
            Besides the important changes listed below, the most important areas with
            improvements in this release are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Many bugfixes in tables, plus some new features (full support for keeps and
              breaks, border conditionality, background on columns and header/footer/body)
            </li>
            <li>
              Improvements and bugfixes for font handling and font
              auto-detection/-registration.
            </li>
            <li>
              Performance improvements and memory optimizations for the property handling
              in the FO tree.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Please note that with this release, we've dropped support for Java 1.3.
            FOP will, from now on, <strong>require at least Java 1.4</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            There have been a few changes in tables that make FOP both more strict and more
            compliant to the Recommendation:
            <ul>
              <li>XSL-FO 1.1 explicitly states that a row-spanning fo:table-cell element is not
                allowed to span further than its enclosing fo:table-header/footer/body element
                (see bottom of <link href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xsl11/#fo_table">section
                  6.7.3</link>). From now on FOP will give a validation error if a document
                contains such an erroneous cell.
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>If an fo:table element contains explicit fo:table-column children, then those
                  elements set the total number of columns in the table. This means that a
                  validation error will now occur if a row contains more cells than available
                  columns. This change allows to improve performance, since the rendering of the
                  table may start as soon as the table-column elements have been parsed.</p>
                <p>If more flexibility is needed, then the fo:table-column elements may be just
                  omitted. The final number of columns will then be set by the row that has the
                  most cells.</p>
            </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            The image libraries Jimi and JAI are no longer needed (and used) for image loading.
            Instead we rely completely on the Image I/O API that has been introduced with
            Java 1.4. If you still need support for bitmap image formats that do not work
            out-of-the-box, we recommend adding
            <link href="http://jai-imageio.dev.java.net/">JAI Image I/O Tools</link>
            (an Image I/O compatible image codec package) to the classpath. JAI is still required
            for building the FOP distribution but it is optional for normal builds and at run-time.
          </p>

     A full list of changes in this release <a href="changes_0.95beta.html">is available</a>.
      </note><section><title>Changes to the Bundled Extensions</title><ul><li><icon alt="add" src="../images/add.jpg"/>
        Added new extension element: fox:external-document. It allows to add whole documents
        such as multi-page TIFF images to be inserted as peers to a page-sequence. Each image
        will make up an entire page. See the documentation for details.
       Committed by JM.</li></ul></section><section><title>Changes to the Image Support</title><ul><li><icon alt="fix" src="../images/fix.jpg"/>
        A new image loading framework has been introduced to fix various problems with external
        graphics and improve performance.
       Committed by JM.</li></ul></section><section><title>Changes to the Layout Engine</title><ul><li><icon alt="add" src="../images/add.jpg"/>
        Added support for background on fo:table-column and fo:table-header/footer/body elements.
       Committed by VH.</li><li><icon alt="add" src="../images/add.jpg"/>
        Added support for conditional borders in tables, for both the separate and the collapsing
        border model.
       Committed by VH. See Issue <link href="http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=43934">43934</link>.</li><li><icon alt="add" src="../images/add.jpg"/>
        Added support for scale-down-to-fit and scale-up-to-fit (introduced in XSL 1.1).
       Committed by JM.</li></ul></section><section><title>Changes to Renderers (Output Formats)</title><ul><li><icon alt="update" src="../images/update.jpg"/>
        PDF Transcoder (SVG) text painting has been completely rewritten.
        Except for some special cases (with filters for example), all text
        (including flow text) is now painted using PDF text operators.
       Committed by JM.</li></ul></section></section></body></document>
