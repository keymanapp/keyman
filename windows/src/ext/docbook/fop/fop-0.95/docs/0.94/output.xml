    <p>
      FOP supports multiple output formats by using a different renderer for each format.
      The renderers do not all have the same set of capabilities, sometimes because of 
      the output format itself, sometimes because some renderers get more development 
      attention than others.

        <title>Fonts</title>
        <p>
          Most FOP renderers use a FOP-specific system for font registration.
          However, the Java2D/AWT and print renderers use the Java AWT package, which gets its 
          font information from the operating system registration.
          This can result in several differences, including actually using different fonts, 
          and having different font metrics for the same font.
          The net effect is that the layout of a given FO document can be quite different between 
          renderers that do not use the same font information.
        </p>

      <section id="general-direct-output">
        <title>Output to a Printer or Other Device</title>
        <p>
          The most obvious way to print your document is to use the FOP 
          <link href="#print">print renderer</link>, which uses the Java2D API (AWT).
          However, you can also send output from the Postscript renderer directly to a Postscript 
          device, or output from the PCL renderer directly to a PCL device.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are Windows command-line examples for Postscript and PCL:
        </p>
        <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[fop ... -ps \\computername\printer]]></source>
        <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[fop ... -pcl \\computername\printer]]></source>
        <p>
          Here is some Java code to accomplish the task in UNIX:
        </p>
        <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[proc = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("lp -d" + print_queue + " -o -dp -");
out = proc.getOutputStream();]]></source>
        <p>
          Set the output MIME type to "application/x-pcl" (MimeConstants.MIME_PCL) and 
          it happily sends the PCL to the UNIX printer queue.

      <title>PDF</title>
      <p>
        PDF is the best supported output format. It is also the most accurate
        with text and layout. This creates a PDF document that is streamed out
        as each page is rendered. This means that the internal page index
        information is stored near the end of the document.
        The PDF version supported is 1.4. PDF versions are forwards/backwards
        compatible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that FOP does not currently support "tagged PDF" or PDF/A-1a. 
        Support for <link href="pdfa.html">PDF/A-1b</link> and <link href="pdfx.html">PDF/X</link> has recently been added, however.
      </p>
      <section id="pdf-fonts">
        <title>Fonts</title>
        <p>
          PDF has a set of fonts that are always available to all PDF viewers;
          to quote from the PDF Specification:

          <em>"PDF prescribes a set of 14 standard fonts that can be used without prior
          definition.
          These include four faces each of three Latin text typefaces (Courier,
          Helvetica, and Times), as well as two symbolic fonts (Symbol and ITC Zapf
          Dingbats). These fonts, or suitable substitute fonts with the same metrics, are
          guaranteed to be available in all PDF viewer applications."</em>
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="pdf-postprocess">
        <title>Post-processing</title>
        <p>
          FOP does not currently support several desirable PDF features: XMP metadata and watermarks. 
          One workaround is to use Adobe Acrobat (the full version, not the Reader) to process 
          the file manually or with scripting that it supports.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another popular post-processing tool is <link href="http://www.lowagie.com/iText">iText</link>, 
          which has tools for adding security features, document properties, watermarks, and many 
          other features to PDF files.
        </p>
        <warning>
          Caveat: iText may swallow PDF bookmarks. But 
          <link href="http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=37589">Jens Stavnstrup tells us</link>
          that this doesn't happen if you use iText's PDFStamper.
        </warning>
        <p>
          Here is some sample code that uses iText to encrypt a FOP-generated PDF. (Note that FOP now 
          supports <link href="pdfencryption.html">PDF encryption</link>. However the principles for using 
          iText for other PDF features are similar.)

    <p>
      In addition to the <link href="#pdf-postprocess">PDF Post-processing</link> options, consider the following workarounds:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Use a background image for the body region.
      </li>
      <li>
        (submitted by Trevor Campbell) Place an image in a
        region that overlaps the flowing text. For example, make
        region-before large enough to contain your image. Then include a
        block (if necessary, use an absolutely positioned block-container)
        containing the watermark image in the static-content for the
        region-before. Note that the image will be drawn on top of the
        normal content.

<section id="ps">
  <title>PostScript</title>
  <p>
    The PostScript renderer has been brought up to a similar quality as the 
    PDF renderer, but may still be missing certain features. It provides good 
    support for most text and layout.
    Images and SVG are not fully supported, yet. Currently, the PostScript
    renderer generates PostScript Level 3 with most DSC comments. Actually,
    the only Level 3 features used are the FlateDecode and DCTDecode 
    filter (the latter is used for 1:1 embedding of JPEG images), everything 
    else is Level 2.
  </p>
    <section id="ps-configuration">
      <title>Configuration</title>
      <p>
        The PostScript renderer configuration currently allows the following settings:
      </p>
<source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[<renderer mime="application/postscript">
  <auto-rotate-landscape>false</auto-rotate-landscape>
  <language-level>3</language-level>
  <optimize-resources>false</optimize-resources>
</renderer>]]></source>
      <p>
        The default value for the "auto-rotate-landscape" setting is "false". Setting it
        to "true" will automatically rotate landscape pages and will mark them as landscape.
      </p>
      <p>
        The default value for the "language-level" setting is "3". This setting specifies
        the PostScript language level which should be used by FOP. Set this to "2"
        only if you don't have a Level 3 capable interpreter.
      </p>
      <p>
        The default value for the "optimize-resources" setting is "false". Setting it
        to "true" will produce the PostScript file in two steps. A temporary file will be
        written first which will then be processed to add only the fonts which were really
        used and images are added to the stream only once as PostScript forms. This will
        reduce file size but can potentially increase the memory needed in the interpreter
        to process.

    <title>Limitations</title>
    <ul>

      <li>Only Type 1 fonts are supported.</li>

  <section id="pcl">
    <title>PCL</title>
    <p>
      This format is for the Hewlett-Packard PCL printers and other printers 
      supporting PCL. It should produce output as close to identical as possible 
      to the printed output of the PDFRenderer within the limitations of the
      renderer, and output device.
    </p>
    <p>
      The output created by the PCLRenderer is generic PCL 5, HP GL/2 and PJL.
      This should allow any device fully supporting PCL 5 to be able to
      print the output generated by the PCLRenderer. PJL is used to control the
      print job and switch to the PCL language. PCL 5 is used for text, raster 
      graphics and rectangular fill graphics. HP GL/2 is used for more complex
      painting operations. Certain painting operations are done off-screen and
      rendered to PCL as bitmaps because of limitations in PCL 5.

      <title>Limitations</title>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Text or graphics outside the left or top of the printable area are not 
          rendered properly. This is a limitation of PCL, not FOP. In general, 
          things that should print to the left of the printable area are shifted 
          to the right so that they start at the left edge of the printable area.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Helvetica and Times fonts are not well supported among PCL printers 
          so Helvetica is mapped to Arial and Times is mapped to Times New. This 
          is done in the PCLRenderer, no changes are required in the FO's. The 
          metrics and appearance for Helvetica/Arial and Times/Times New are 
          nearly identical, so this has not been a problem so far.
        </li>
        <li>For the non-symbol fonts, the ISO 8859-1 symbol set is used (PCL set "0N").</li>
        <li>
          All fonts available to the Java2D subsystem are usable. The texts are
          painted as bitmap much like the Windows PCL drivers do.
        </li>
        <li>Multibyte characters are not supported.</li>
        <li>
          At the moment, only monochrome output is supported. PCL5c color extensions
          will only be implemented on demand. Color and grayscale images are converted
          to monochrome bitmaps (1-bit). Dithering only occurs if the JAI image library
          is available.
        </li>
        <li>
          Images are scaled up to the next resolution level supported by PCL (75, 
          100, 150, 200, 300, 600 dpi). For color and grayscale images an even
          higher PCL resolution is selected to give the dithering algorithm a chance
          to improve the bitmap quality.
        </li>
        <li>
          Currently, there's no support for clipping and image transparency, largely 
          because PCL 5 has certain limitations.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="pcl-configuration">
      <title>Configuration</title>
      <p>
        The PCL renderer configuration currently allows the following settings:
      </p>
<source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[<renderer mime="application/vnd.hp-PCL">
  <rendering>quality</rendering>
  <text-rendering>bitmap</text-rendering>
</renderer>]]></source>
      <p>
        The default value for the "rendering" setting is "speed" which causes borders 
        to be painted as plain rectangles. In this mode, no special borders (dotted, 
        dashed etc.) are available. If you want support for all border modes, set the
        value to "quality" as indicated above. This will cause the borders to be painted
        as bitmaps.
      </p>
      <p>
        The default value for the "text-rendering" setting is "auto" which paints the
        base fonts using PCL fonts. Non-base fonts are painted as bitmaps through Java2D.
        If the mix of painting methods results in unwelcome output, you can set this
        to "bitmap" which causes all text to be rendered as bitmaps.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can control the output resolution for the PCL using the "target resolution" 
        setting on the FOUserAgent. The actual value will be rounded up to the next
        supported PCL resolution. Currently, only 300 and 600 dpi are supported which
        should be enough for most use cases. Note that this setting directly affects
        the size of the output file and the print quality.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="pcl-extensions">
      <title>Extensions</title>
      <p>The PCL Renderer supports some PCL specific extensions which can be embedded 
      into the input FO document. To use the extensions the appropriate namespace must 
      be declared in the fo:root element like this:</p>
      <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
      <fo:root xmlns:fo="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Format"
               xmlns:pcl="http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/extensions/pcl">
]]></source>
      <section id="pcl-page-source">
        <title>Page Source (Tray selection)</title>
        <p>
          The page-source extension attribute on fo:simple-page-master allows to 
          select the paper tray the sheet for a particular simple-page-master is
          to be taken from. Example:
        </p>
      <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
      <fo:layout-master-set>
        <fo:simple-page-master master-name="simple" pcl:paper-source="2">
          ...
        </fo:simple-page-master>
      </fo:layout-master-set>
]]></source>
        <p>
          Note: the tray number is a positive integer and the value depends on
          the target printer. Not all PCL printers support the same paper trays.
          Usually, 
          "1" is the default tray,
          "2" is the manual paper feed, 
          "3" is the manual envelope feed, 
          "4" is the "lower" tray and
          "7" is "auto-select".
          Consult the technical reference for your printer for all available values.

      <p>Experimentation has shown that the font metrics for the FOP built-in Base14 fonts are actually
      very similar to some of the IBM outline and raster fonts. In cases were the IBM font files are not
      available the path attribute in the afp-font element can be replaced by a base14-font attribute 
      giving the name of the matching Base14 font. In this case the AFP Renderer will take the
      font metrics from the built-in font.</p>

  <title>RTF</title>
  <p>
    JFOR, an open source XSL-FO to RTF converter has been integrated into Apache FOP.
    This will create an RTF (rich text format) document that will
    attempt to contain as much information from the fo document as
    possible. The RTF output follows Microsoft's RTF specifications
    and produces best results on Microsoft Word.
  </p>
  <note>RTF output is currently unmaintained and lacks many features compared to other output
    formats. Using other editable formats like Open Document Format, instead of producing XSL-FO
    then RTF through FOP, might give better results.</note>

  </p>
  <p>
    The other use case of the Area Tree XML is as FOP's "intermediate format". More information

    <p>
      The Java2DRenderer provides the basic functionality for all 
      Java2D-based output formats (AWT viewer, direct print, PNG, TIFF).
    </p>
    <p>
      The AWT viewer shows a window with the pages displayed inside a
      Java graphic. It displays one page at a time.
      The fonts used for the formatting and viewing depend on the fonts
      available to your JRE.
    </p>
</section>
<section id="print">
  <title>Print</title>
  <p>
    It is possible to directly print the document from the command line.
    This is done with the same code that renders to the Java2D/AWT renderer.
  </p>
</section>
<section id="bitmap">
  <title>Bitmap (TIFF/PNG)</title>
  <p>
    It is possible to directly create bitmap images from the individual 
    pages generated by the layout engine.
    This is done with the same code that renders to the Java2D/AWT renderer.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, two output formats are supported: PNG and TIFF. TIFF produces
    one file with multiple pages, while PNG output produces one file per
    page. The quality of the bitmap depends on the target resolution setting 
    on the FOUserAgent.
  </p>
    <section id="bitmap-configuration">
      <title>Configuration</title>
      <p>
        The TIFF and PNG renderer configuration currently allows the following settings:
      </p>
<source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[<renderer mime="image/png">
  <transparent-page-background>true</transparent-page-background>
  <fonts><!-- described elsewhere --></fonts>
</renderer>]]></source>
      <p>
        The default value for the "transparent-page-background" setting is "false" which 
        paints an opaque, white background for the whole image. If you set this to true,
        no such background will be painted and you will get a transparent image if
        an alpha channel is available in the output format.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="tiff-configuration">
      <title>TIFF-specific Configuration</title>
      <p>
        In addition to the above values the TIFF renderer configuration allows some additional
        settings:
      </p>
<source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[<renderer mime="image/tiff">
  <transparent-page-background>true</transparent-page-background>
  <compression>CCITT T.6</compression>
  <fonts><!-- described elsewhere --></fonts>
</renderer>]]></source>
      <p>
        The default value for the "compression" setting is "PackBits" which 
        which is a widely supported RLE compression scheme for TIFF. The set of compression
        names to be used here matches the set that the Image I/O API uses. Note that
        not all compression schemes may be available during runtime. This depends on the
        actual codecs being available. Here is a list of possible values:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>NONE (no compression)</li>
        <li>PackBits (RLE, run-length encoding)</li>
        <li>JPEG</li>
        <li>Deflate</li>
        <li>LZW</li>
        <li>ZLib</li>
        <li>CCITT T.4 (Fax Group 3)</li>
        <li>CCITT T.6 (Fax Group 4)</li>
      </ul>
      <note>
        If you want to use CCITT compression, please make sure you've got a J2SE 1.4 or later and
        <link href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jai/current.html">
          Java Advanced Imaging Image I/O Tools
        </link>
        in your classpath. The Sun JRE doesn't come with a TIFF codec built in, so it has to be
        added separately. The internal TIFF codec from XML Graphics Commons only supports PackBits,
        Deflate and JPEG compression for writing.

<section id="txt">
  <title>TXT</title>
  <p>
    The text renderer produces plain ASCII text output
    that attempts to match the output of the PDFRenderer as closely as
    possible. This was originally developed to accommodate an archive system
    that could only accept plain text files, and is primarily useful for getting
    a quick-and-dirty view of the document text. The renderer is very limited,
    so do not be surprised if it gives unsatisfactory results.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Text renderer works with a fixed size page buffer. The size of this
    buffer is controlled with the textCPI and textLPI public variables.
    The textCPI is the effective horizontal characters per inch to use.
    The textLPI is the vertical lines per inch to use. From these values
    and the page width and height the size of the buffer is calculated.
    The formatting objects to be rendered are then mapped to this grid.
    Graphic elements (lines, borders, etc) are assigned a lower priority
    than text, so text will overwrite any graphic element representations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because FOP lays the text onto a grid during layout, there are frequently 
    extra or missing spaces between characters and lines, which is generally 
    unsatisfactory.
    Users have reported that the optimal settings to avoid such spacing problems are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>font-family="Courier"</li>
    <li>font-size="7.3pt"</li>
    <li>line-height="10.5pt"</li>

    Due to the state of certain renderers we moved some of them to a "sandbox" area until 
    they are ready for more serious use. The renderers and FOEventHandlers in the sandbox
    can be found under src/sandbox and are compiled into build/fop-sandbox.jar during the
    main build. The output formats in the sandbox are marked as such below.

   <section id="svg">
     <title>SVG</title>
     <warning>The SVG renderer is in the sandbox and may not work as expected in FOP Trunk!!! Please help us improve this feature.</warning>
     <p>
       This format creates an SVG document that has links between the pages.
       This is primarily for slides and creating svg images of pages.
       Large documents will create SVG files that are far too large for
       an SVG viewer to handle. Since FO documents usually have text the
       SVG document will have a large number of text elements.
       The font information for the text is obtained from the JVM in the
       same way as for the AWT viewer. If the SVG is viewed on a
       system where the fonts are different, such as another platform,
       then the page may look wrong.
