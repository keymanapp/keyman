      <title>18 April 2006 - Apache FOP 0.92 beta released</title>
      <p>
        A second "beta" grade release of the new FOP codebase with a modified and
        now considered stable API. The release contains many bug fixes as well as
        new features mainly related to even more extensive support of the XSL-FO
        specification. This is expected to be the last "beta" release before we
        go to a 1.0 release!

      <title>20 October 2004 - Creation of the Apache XML Graphics project</title>
      <p>
        The Apache Board of Directors agreed to the creation of the 
        <link href="http://xmlgraphics.apache.org">Apache XML Graphics</link>
        project which will be comprised of Batik and FOP. Both former 
        Apache XML subprojects are in this way complying with the Board's desire
        to improve project oversight. Both project teams also see additional
        benefits of working more closely together.
