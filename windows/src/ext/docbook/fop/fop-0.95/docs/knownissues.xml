  <title>Known issues</title>
  <p>
    This page lists currently known issues in the FOP codebase. Please note that this list is generated
    from data in FOP's code repository (Trunk) and may not exactly represent the list of issues in
    the latest release.
  </p>
  <note>
    <p>
      For additional information on known issues in Apache FOP, please have a look at the following pages, too:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><link href="bugs.html">the bug list in Bugzilla</link></li>
      <li><link href="http://wiki.apache.org/xmlgraphics-fop/FOPProjectTasks">the task list in the Wiki</link></li>
    </ul>
  </note>
  <p>
    Apache FOP has an extensive automated testing infrastructure. Parts of this infrastructure are several 
    sets of test cases. When a test case is listed in disabled-testcases.xml it is disabled in the JUnit 
    tests during the normal build process. This indicates a problem in the current codebase. When a bug is 
    fixed or a missing feature is added the entry for the relevant test case(s) are removed.
