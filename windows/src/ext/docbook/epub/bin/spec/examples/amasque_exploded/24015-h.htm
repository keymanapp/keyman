The question being proposed, who had the greatest number of followers—the
Quarter Days said, there could be no question as to that; for they had all
the creditors in the world dogging their heels. But April Fool gave it in
favour of the Forty Days before Easter; because the debtors in all cases
outnumbered the creditors, &amp; they kept <em>lent</em> all the year round.</p>

April Fool, who likes a bit of sport above measure, &amp; had some
pretensions to the lady besides as being but a cousin once
removed,—clapped &amp; halloo’d them on; and as fast as their indignation
cooled those mad wag’s, the Ember Days, were at it with their bellows, to
