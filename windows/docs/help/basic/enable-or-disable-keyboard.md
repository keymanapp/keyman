title: Keyboard Task - Enable or Disable a Keyboard
---

Keyman keyboards can be enabled and disabled. When disabled, they are
removed from the list of keyboards you can select from, but they are
not uninstalled.

## Disabling a Keyman keyboard

Disabling a Keyman keyboard removes it from the Keyman menu and Keyman
Toolbox but does not uninstall the keyboard. This is useful if:

-   You are using a single keyboard layout from a package with multiple
    keyboards and you want to remove the extra keyboards from the Keyman
    Toolbox and menu.

-   You have a keyboard layout installed which you aren\'t currently
    using but don\'t want to uninstall.

To disable a Keyman keyboard:

1.  Open Keyman.

2.  Click on the Keyman icon ![](../desktop_images/icon-keyman.png), on the
    Windows Taskbar near the clock.

3.  Select Configuration.

4.  Select the Keyboard Layouts tab.

5.  Select the keyboard name you want to disable to expand options associated with it.

6.  Click on the Disable button.

7.  Click OK.

When a keyboard layout is disabled, its name and details appear in grey and the disable
button now says enable. The Add/remove language... button is also disabled as this option is 
not available while the keyboard is disabled.
