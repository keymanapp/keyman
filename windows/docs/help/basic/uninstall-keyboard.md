Uninstalling a Keyman keyboard removes it from Keyman. If you want to
use the Keyman keyboard again it must be reinstalled.

**Note:** You can disable a keyboard temporarily, instead of uninstalling it. For
more help, see: [Keyboard Task - Enable or Disable a Keyboard](enable-or-disable-keyboard).

To uninstall a Keyman keyboard:

1.  Open Keyman.

2.  Click on the Keyman icon ![](../desktop_images/icon-keyman.png), on the

    expand options associated with it.

6.  Click the Uninstall button.

    or keyboard layout that you wish to uninstall.

8.  Click OK.

The Keyman keyboard is now removed from Keyman.
