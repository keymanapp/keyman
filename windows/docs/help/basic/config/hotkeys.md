## Setting Hotkeys

For help setting hotkeys in the Hotkeys tab of Keyman Configuration,
see: [How To - Set Hotkeys for Keyman, Keyman Keyboards and Windows Languages](../../start/hotkey_set)

**Note:**
By default, hotkeys only turn on a function or keyboard. If you prefer
hotkeys to turn on or off a function or keyboard, you can change this
behaviour in the [Options tab](options) of Keyman
Configuration. Tick \'Keyboard hotkeys toggle keyboard activation\' and
click OK.

Some hotkeys do not toggle even if this option is enabled. Only the
following hotkeys will toggle with this option enabled:

-   Show On Screen Keyboard Pane
-   Show Keyboard Usage Pane
-   Show Font Helper Pane
-   Show Character Map Pane
-   Any Keyman Keyboard Hotkey
