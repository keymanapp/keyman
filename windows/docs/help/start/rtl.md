title: How To - Type in Right-to-Left Languages
---

If you will be typing in a right-to-left language (like Arabic, Farsi,
Hebrew, or Yiddish) there are three things you should know before you
get started.

1.  Your computer must be set up for right-to-left language support.
    Keyman will automatically set up your computer for most Keyman
    keyboards that need right-to-left language support. However, you may
    need to manually adjust your settings for some Keyman keyboards.
    Otherwise, without right-to-left language support, letters in your
    right-to-left language might appear in the wrong order, not join
    correctly, or change after the spacebar is pressed.

    To do this, simply associate the keyboard with a right-to-left
    Windows language (like Arabic). For instructions on associating a
    Keyman keyboard with a Windows language, see:
    [How To - Set up Your Computer for a Keyman Keyboard](configure-computer)

2.  If you will be using MS Office programs like Word, you should
    configure MS Office for your right-to-left language. For
    instructions, see:
    [How To - Set up MS Office for a Keyman Keyboard](configure_office)

3.  Each time you start typing with a right-to-left Keyman keyboard, you
    may need to change the typing direction in the program you are
    using, from left-to-right to right-to-left. In most Windows programs
    (including MS Word, Internet Explorer, and Notepad), you can use the
    following shortcuts to switch direction:

    -   For right-to-left, press: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Right Shift</kbd>
    -   For left-to-right, press: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Left.Shift</kbd>

    In Firefox:

    -   To toggle between right-to-left and left-to-right, press:
        <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd>
