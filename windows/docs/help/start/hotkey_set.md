title: How To - Set Hotkeys for Keyman, Keyman Keyboards and Windows Languages
---

A hotkey is a keyboard shortcut. In Keyman these are used to turn on and
off Keyman functions, Keyman keyboards and Windows languages.

To set the hotkey for a Keyman function, Keyman keyboard or Windows
language:

1.  Open Keyman Configuration, from the Keyman menu in the Windows
    taskbar.

2.  Select the Hotkeys tab.

    Change Hotkey dialog box will be displayed.

4.  Select a default hotkey or click Custom and type the hotkey you wish
    to use.

    **Note:** If you press a single letter or Shift plus a single letter, the
    hotkey will default to <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> plus the letter you pressed, in
    order to avoid conflicts with standard keyboard input.

    **Note:** To clear a hotkey that has been set previously, click Clear Hotkey
    or press Backspace.

    **Note:** Be aware that you can set the hotkey to replace common Windows hotkeys (
    <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd>, etc). This is not
    recommended.

5.  Click OK to save your selection.

The new hotkey will now be available.
