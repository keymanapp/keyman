title: How To - Set up Your Computer for a Keyman Keyboard
---

Keyman will automatically set up your computer for best performance with
most Keyman keyboards. However, for best performance on some keyboards
you may need to manually associate your Keyman keyboard with a Windows
language and layout.

## Benefits of Association

Correctly associating your Keyman keyboard has three main benefits.

1.  When a Keyman keyboard and Windows language are correctly
    associated, turning one on will activate the other. You won't need
    to adjust both every time you want to use your Keyman keyboard.

2.  When a Windows layout and a Keyman keyboard are correctly
    associated, you can be sure you are using a Keyman keyboard as it
    was designed. This is especially helpful if you are using a
    non-English hardware keyboard as your Windows layout. For example,
    if you are using a Spanish, French, or German hardware keyboard.

3.  When a Windows language and a Keyman keyboard are correctly
    associated, your computer will know which language the keyboard is
    using. This is helpful for many reasons:

    -   Applications will know which typing direction to use,
        left-to-right or right-to-left. This is necessary for
        right-to-left languages like Arabic, Hebrew, and Farsi.

    -   Applications will know how characters and symbols should be
        rendered. This is particularly necessary for many Indian
        languages.

    -   Applications will know which language tools to use when spell
        checking what you type.
