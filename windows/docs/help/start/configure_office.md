---

Keyman will automatically set up your Microsoft Office programs for best
performance with most Keyman keyboards. However, you may need to
manually adjust your MS Office language settings for some Keyman
keyboards.

## Benefits to Configuring Language Settings for MS Office

The Microsoft Office language settings control spell checking,
autocorrection, and other language-specific features for the programs in
the Microsoft Office suite (including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook,
Publisher, Access, OneNote, Groove, and InfoPath). If you will be using
any of the MS Office programs with your Keyman keyboard, in order to
enjoy these features you will need to configure MS Office language
settings.
