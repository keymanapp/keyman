## Fix Characters Appearing Smaller than the Selected Font Size

If you are typing with a font that does not include all character
glyphs, some characters may appear at a smaller size than the selected
font size.

This is due to Windows font-linking -- it automatically selects a
different font for those characters when the current font does not
contain glyphs for them.

To correct this problem, select a font which includes glyphs for all the
characters you are using.

EXAMPLE: In Notepad, using the SIL IPA Unicode keyboard, type 'hat\_'.
With the standard Notepad font selected (Lucida Console) the 't\_'
appears at a smaller size to the 'ha'.
