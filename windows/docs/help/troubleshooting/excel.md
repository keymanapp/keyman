## Using Keyman in Excel with the / Key

Keyboard layouts which rely on the '/' key cause difficulty in Microsoft
Excel. In order to provide legacy compatibility with Lotus 1-2-3, by
default using the '/' key in Excel activates keyboard shortcuts. There
are two solutions to this problem.

### Solution 1

Press F2 -- Whenever you type text in Excel using a layout which relies
on '/', press the F2 key to enter the cell before typing.

### Solution 2

Disable '/' shortcuts -- In the Microsoft Office Excel menu, disable the
use of '/' as a shortcut key.

In Excel 2007:

1.  Open Excel's Options menu.

2.  Select Advanced.

3.  Scroll down to Lotus Compatibility.

4.  Delete '/' in the text box beside Microsoft Office Excel menu key.

5.  Click OK.

## Keeping Context in Excel

The first key typed into any cell in Excel causes Excel to switch input
into a new window. The switch of windows between the first and second
key typed will cause Keyman to lose context. Any subsequent keys typed
will be fine, but youâ€™ll run into difficulty if you depend on the
context of the first character. To avoid this problem, you need to press
F2 first before typing in any cell.
