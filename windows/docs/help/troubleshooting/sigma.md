title: How To - Fix Greek Medial Sigma Changing to Final Sigma Unexpectedly in MS Word
---

## Symptoms

When typing Greek in Microsoft Word using any Polytonic Greek-script
keyboard, entering a diacritic or breathing mark on a vowel after a
Sigma immediately causes the Sigma to incorrectly change to a final
Sigma. For instance, if you typed ησὴ you would get ηςὴ.

Ordinals setting.
