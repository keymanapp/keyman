title: Does Keyman run on a Mac?
---

Yes. Please visit [Keyman for macOS](https://keyman.com/macos/) for more
information. Also note that there are two other ways you can use Keyman
keyboards on a Mac:

1.  If you are running Windows on your Mac (through a program like
    Fusion, Parallels or BootCamp) you can use Keyman through Windows.

2.  We offer a web-based typing application, KeymanWeb. It works in all
    major browsers (Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Edge, etc), on any OS that
    supports those browsers. You can use KeymanWeb at <https://keymanweb.com>.
