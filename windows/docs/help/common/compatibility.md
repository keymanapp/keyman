title: Does Keyman work with all software?
---

Keyman works well with nearly all modern applications. Some older
applications do not allow display of non-European languages, or do not
support Unicode. We have written add-ins for some applications which
allow Keyman to work around those limitations.

If you have trouble getting Keyman to work with an application, visit
our [community forums](https://community.software.sil.org/c/keyman).
