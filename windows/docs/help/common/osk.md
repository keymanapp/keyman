title: Does Keyman include a virtual on-screen keyboard?
---

Yes. However, some of the Keyman keyboards available on our website do
not currently include an On Screen Keyboard. To know if a keyboard
download includes an On Screen Keyboard, look for the
![](../desktop_images/icon-osk.png) icon in the Keyman keyboard downloads
list.

To check if an installed keyboard includes an On Screen Keyboard, start
Keyman Configuration, navigate to the Keyboards tab, and expand the
details for the keyboard. The On Screen Keyboard entry in the details
will give more information on whether or not an On Screen Keyboard is
available for the selected keyboard.
