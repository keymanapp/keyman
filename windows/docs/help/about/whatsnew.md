Here are some of the new features we have added to Keyman 19.0 for Windows:

- Minimum supported version of Windows is 10.0
- Updates to Keyman are now applied before Keyman starts for the first time in a session, so Windows no longer needs to be restarted (#10041)
- Keyman no longer adds a desktop shortcut when it is installed (#11401)
- Added an option to make Right Alt and Right Control also work for keyboard switching hotkeys if preferred (#11471)
